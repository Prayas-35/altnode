B O O K ?

Why this book? In writing The Beginner’s Guide to Real Estate Investing, my intent has been to cover all topics that ﬁrst-time real estate investors need to know—but to do so in less depth than I’ve included in
my previous Wiley titles.
Here you’ll ﬁnd discussions about credit scoring, mortgages, seller
ﬁnancing, negotiation, foreclosures, bargain-hunting, appraisal, valuation,
creating value, cash ﬂow analysis, property management, and dozens of
other topics. In this book, you’ll gain a proﬁt-generating introduction to
the complete range of knowledge you’ll need to begin building wealth
in real estate.
In other words, another title for this book might have been Real Estate Investing in a Nutshell.This book is directed toward those readers
who want to sample all investment topics in one easy-to-read volume.
In contrast, for those readers and experienced investors who prefer
more depth on each of the topics discussed herein, I might suggest that,
you instead select from some combination of these titles: Investing in
Real Estate, 4th ed. (with Andrew McLean), Make Money with FixerUppers and Renovations, Make Money with Small Income Properties,
Make Money with Condominiums and Townhouses, The 106 Mortgage Secrets All Borrowers Must Know—but Lenders Don’t Tell, The
106 Common Mistakes Homebuyers Make—and How to Avoid Them,
3rd ed., and The Complete Guide to Second Homes for Vacations, Retirement, and Investment.

WHY THIS BOOK?

Either way, whether you select this abridged volume or some combination of my other titles, you’ll ﬁnd that I always offer my readers the
most detailed and practical guides to investing in real estate that are
available. Although I am quite optimistic on your opportunities to build
wealth with property, I never mislead my readers into believing that this
wealth will come without knowledge, time, and effort.
It’s certainly true.You can still get rich in real estate. But you must
learn how to analyze properties, neighborhoods, and ﬁnancial risks and
rewards. And that’s exactly what my books will help you learn.
I wish you good luck and good fortune.

Get Started Now

In this book, I want to motivate and educate you. I want to get you
started in real estate. I hope to persuade you that real estate investing
can still lead you to a lifetime of wealth and personal fulﬁllment. No matter what ﬁnancial goals you
set for yourself, no matter how little cash, credit, or

can still build your fortune in real estate.

Just Say No to Excuses
“But wait a minute,” you say. “You can’t be talking to me. In my area of
the country, property prices have climbed sky-high. Besides, I really
don’t have enough cash, credit, or time to get started. And even if I did,
real estate seems too complex. I can’t even balance my checkbook.”
As I travel throughout the country and talk with would-be beginning investors, I repeatedly hear these types of excuses. But it may surprise you to learn that I’ve heard these same excuses for nearly 30 years.

Naysayers Thrive in All Times and Places
When times are good, people fret over the deals they’ve missed. When
times are bad, these same folks claim that real estate is no longer a good

investment. Either way, they always ﬁnd some way to color the future
bleak (see Box 1.1).
Yet, since the early 1970s I have seen all types of booms and busts.
I have seen 18 percent mortgage interest rates. I’ve lived through the
multiple turmoils of double-digit rates of inﬂation, the disastrous 1986
Tax Reform Act (which killed off the most proﬁtable
real estate tax shelter techniques), and the recent

all of the other types of markets in between.

Among all the lessons history teaches, none is more certain than the
fact that home prices will go up. Regardless of how high you think
prices are today, they will be higher 10 years from now and much,
much higher 20 or 30 years into the future. Don’t make the mistake
of believing that “home prices have reached their peak.” Before you
accept the naysaying of so-called economic experts, take a quick
trip through some of their faulty predictions from years gone by:
◆ The prices of houses seem to have reached a plateau, and there is

reasonable expectancy that prices will decline. (Time, December
1, 1947)
◆ Houses cost too much for the mass market. Today’s average price
is around $8,000—out of reach for two-thirds of all buyers. (Science Digest, April 1948)
◆ If you have bought your house since the War . . . you have made
your deal at the top of the market. . . . The days when you couldn’t
lose on a house purchase are no longer with us. (House Beautiful,
November 1948)
◆ The goal of owning a home seems to be getting beyond the reach
of more and more Americans. The typical new house today costs
about $28,000. (Business Week, September 4, 1969)

Get Started Now

(Continued)
◆ Be suspicious of the “common wisdom” that tells you to “Buy

now . . . because continuing inﬂation will force home prices and
rents higher and higher.” (NEA Journal, December 1970)
◆ The median price of a home today is approaching $50,000. . . .
Housing experts predict that in the future price rises won’t be that
great. (Nation’s Business, June 1977)
◆ The era of easy proﬁts in real estate may be drawing to a close.
(Money, January 1981)
◆ In California . . . for example, it is not unusual to ﬁnd families of average means buying $100,000 houses. . . . I’m conﬁdent prices
have passed their peak. (J. E. English and G. E. Cardiff, The Coming
Real Estate Crash, Warner Books, 1980)
◆ The golden age of risk-free run-ups in home prices is gone.
(Money, March 1985)
◆ If you’re looking to buy, be careful. Rising home values are not a
sure thing anymore. (Miami Herald, October 25, 1985)
◆ Most economists agree . . . [a home] will become little more than
a roof and a tax deduction, certainly not the lucrative investment it
was through much of the 1980s. (Money, April 1986)
◆ We’re starting to go back to the time when you bought a home not
for its potential moneymaking abilities, but rather as a nesting
spot. (Los Angeles Times, January 31, 1993)
◆ Financial planners agree that houses will continue to be a poor investment. (Kiplinger’s Personal Financial Magazine, November
1993)
◆ A home is where the bad investment is. (San Francisco Examiner,
November 17, 1996)
◆ Your house is a roof over your head. It is not an investment.
(Karen Ramsey, Everything You Know About Money Is Wrong,
Reagan Books, 1999)
◆ The trends that have produced the housing boom . . . have nearly
run their course. This virtually guarantees . . . plummeting home
prices and mass foreclosures. . . . (John Rubino, How to Proﬁt
from the Coming Real Estate Bust, Rodale, 2003)

Build Wealth in Any Market
You’ve heard it said before,“The only constant is change.”And when markets change, that change creates opportunities. Here are just a few examples:
◆ When prices appreciate fast, you can “ﬁx and ﬂip” for quick proﬁts.
◆ Appreciating prices also give you the tax-free beneﬁt of cash-out reﬁ-

nances.
◆ Falling interest rates (even with stable prices) reward you with a reﬁ-

nance that lowers your monthly payments and increases your cash
ﬂows.
◆ Depressed markets provide you with an abundance of foreclosures,
motivated sellers, and bargain-priced properties.
◆ High rates of inﬂation drive up market interest rates and cut down
short-term demand. That’s the perfect time to look for seller ﬁnancing,
lease options, and low-interest-rate mortgages that you can take over
(assume) from the sellers.
◆ High rates of inﬂation also reduce the number of newly constructed
houses because builders must pay higher construction costs and
higher interest rates. Fewer housing starts clearly signals an excellent
time to buy. A slowdown in new housing always foreshadows a jump in
prices as growing demand outpaces new supply. (California perfectly
illustrates this point—albeit low housing starts in California are now
being caused by tight land-use controls, environmental protection, and
restrictive growth management policies.)

These moneymaking examples merely touch upon the multitude of
strategies you will discover throughout this book, but they illustrate one
central message that I have advocated throughout my career and in all of
my writings:
Q. When’s the best time for you to invest in real estate?
A. Today.
But don’t jump to the wrong conclusion. By saying “invest today,” I
don’t mean that you can never go wrong. Rather, I mean that there’s
never a wrong time to invest if you choose the right strategy. And that’s
what I’m going to show you.

You Must Believe It to See It
Given the large rewards that most savvy real estate investors have
achieved over the years, I’ve often wondered why most people fail to invest in real estate. After much thought and talks
with hundreds of would-be investors, I’ve come to
The time to start
this conclusion: Most people simply don’t believe in
the future and they don’t believe in themselves.
really is now.
As a result, most people don’t believe in their
ability to actually make big money in real estate.
These negative thinkers erect a wall of excuses that blocks their vision.
This wall prevents them from seeing the proﬁt potential that lies in front
of them. So, will you join the ranks of the naysayers? Or will you open
your mind to a promising future?

Imagine the Future
Think about your future. Imagine you’re reading the real estate classiﬁed
ads 10 years from today. What do these ads of tomorrow say?
Are property prices higher or lower than they are today? Are rent
levels higher or lower than they are today? If you believe in the continuing growth of the United States, you must believe that just as with every
past decade, today’s property prices and rent levels will look cheap relative to where they will stand 10 years from now (see Table 1.1).

Reprogram Your Self-Talk
Ask yourself whether you really want to beneﬁt from those future gains.
Or would you prefer to merely watch others reap these near-certain

proﬁts? If you do want to succeed—yet you feel blocked by excuses—
then reprogram your self-talk.
What Is Self-Talk? In his mind-opening book, What To Say When You
Talk to Yourself (Pocket Books, 1986, p. 25), Shad Helmstetter writes,
You will become what you think about most. Your success or
failure in anything, large or small, will depend on your mental
programming—what you accept from others, and what you
say when you talk to yourself.
After years of study, this nationally renowned psychologist has
found that as a matter of habit, most of us swamp our optimism and
hence our motivation to change for the better with negative self-talk.
Think about your own thoughts. Do you accept the
negative as “true” or “the way things really are”? Do
you frequently focus on risks rather than opportuniYou must believe

ther said to yourself or heard others say hundreds of
times:
◆ I can’t remember names.
◆ It’s just no use.
◆ No matter what I do, I just can’t keep the weight off.
◆ I never have enough time.
◆ I’m just too disorganized.
◆ I’m no good at math.
◆ I’m always running late.

Now think about this: If you program yourself with these types of
negative self-descriptions, will you undertake any serious efforts to
change these or other undesirable traits and habits? Of course not! And
the same thing stands true for those beliefs (self-talk) that can block you
from getting started in real estate. Once again, think about the types of
excuses that I frequently hear:
◆ Prices are too high.
◆ I can’t afford to buy.
◆ I missed so many good opportunities.
◆ I can’t get ﬁnancing because of my credit problems.

Get Started Now

◆ It’s too late to get started now. I should have invested years ago.
◆ Real estate will take up too much time.
◆ I don’t want to deal with tenants, stopped-up toilets, leaky roofs,

or broken furnaces.
◆ I don’t know enough to get started—or even how to get started.
◆ We don’t have any extra cash. We’re spending more than we

make.

Use self-talk to
discover and
develop your real
potential.

You may or may not identify with any of these
speciﬁc excuses. But unless you discipline your selftalk far better than most people, you undoubtedly
have at least a few areas where your false beliefs
keep you from taking positive action.
As to real estate investing, I urge you to reprogram your negative self-talk and limiting beliefs with
mind-opening questions such as these:

◆ What are six ways I can save more and spend less?
◆ Where are the best neighborhoods to ﬁnd bargain-priced prop-

erties?
◆ How might I persuade the sellers to accept owner ﬁnancing?
◆ Who do I know with money that I could partner with?
◆ How can I boost my credit score?
◆ How can I improve this property to enhance its value by the

largest amount?
Ideally (at least concerning real estate investing), you must erase
your negative self-talk tapes. Then rerecord positive self-talk. Instead of
bringing yourself down with talk or beliefs that create undesirable
habits, attitudes, and outcomes, focus on the behavior and belief patterns
that will lead you where you want to go. Ask yourself questions that lead
to opportunities and problem-solving.

Why Questions? To solve any problem, ﬁrst ask a question. Questions and the habit of asking them lead you to discover possibilities. People (usually underachievers) who merely settle for preprogrammed
conclusions won’t ask questions. Because they believe they already
know the answers, they unwittingly overlook the choices and the possibilities the world is offering them. You must always realize that if you
don’t like the program you’re living, you’re free to switch the channel.

MINDSET + KNOWLEDGE = WEALTH

10

Questions help
you achieve your
goals.

Lifelong Job? The Wall Street Journal (September 23, 2003, p. D2) published a recent survey by
AARP (formerly known as the American Association
of Retired Persons). The Journal reporter writes,

According to a new study, many American workers are planning to push their retirement age well into their 70s,
or in some cases, their 80s . . . largely because of deep cracks in
their nest eggs. . . . These ﬁndings quantify a signiﬁcant shift in
thinking that is resulting largely because of the stock market
downturn and historically low interest rates on the more conservative investments. . . . The need for money was named as
the primary motivation by workers who plan to stay on the
job . . .
When I read the results of surveys such as this, two thoughts come to
mind:
1. Why didn’t more of these now-disappointed workers invest
more money in real estate instead of stocks?
2. And more important, why don’t they at least get started now?
Starting late most assuredly beats never starting at all.
To know that most of these folks are now rushing into low-yielding
certiﬁcates of deposit, annuities, and government bonds once again reinforces my message here. They’re choosing low yields because they hold
false beliefs about real estate investing. No rational
person could possibly choose lifelong employment
and meager returns on so-called safe investments
No one needs to
such as annuities, bonds, and CDs if they really beaccept low yields.
lieved (and understood) the possibilities that
presently exist in real estate.
Two More False Beliefs In his popular book The Four Pillars of Investing (McGraw-Hill, 2003), William Bernstein repeats two more widely held
myths of modern investing. You’ve heard them before. But they’re false.
1.

“No guts, no glory.” Bernstein claims that if you want to increase your potential rewards from investing, you must learn
to accept more risk. Bernstein writes,“Whether you invest in

Get Started Now

11

stocks, bonds, or for that matter real estate, you are rewarded
mainly for your exposure to one thing—risk.”
2. “The market is smarter than you are.” Here, Bernstein
merely repeats the “efﬁcient market” theory of modern ﬁnance. In an efﬁcient market, all asset prices supposedly reﬂect their true market value. According to Bernstein, you can
never ﬁnd bargain-priced investments.
As they pertain to real estate, both of Bernstein’s so-called pillars of
investing are perfectly silly. When you invest in real estate, you gain these
two proﬁt-generating beneﬁts:
1. In real estate, you are not merely being rewarded for
taking risk. You are rewarded for applying your intelligence
and market savvy. You are rewarded for providing a target market (tenants or buyers) a property that offers better value than
competing properties.
2. You can beat the market. When you put into action the
steps and techniques described in this book, you will discover
and create opportunities that the majority of property owners
(along with those naysayers who shout from the sidelines)
consistently miss.
Nevertheless, these widespread false beliefs can actually work to
boost your investment returns. Because ﬁnancial planners and economists (who typically have no meaningful experience with real estate investing) give such faulty advice, their advice keeps investor competition
for properties far below the level that would otherwise exist.
In other words, as long as most potential inThe false beliefs of
vestors
believe that to earn big returns in real estate
others boost your

on the sidelines. They will leave more opportunities
for you.

Summing Up Self-Talk and False Beliefs No doubt, today’s real estate market will challenge you. But if you keep your eyes on the prize
and your mind ﬁlled with possibilities, you will discover multiple ways
to build real estate wealth (see Chapter 2). As the dynamic speaker, Les

it’s worth it!

Set Goals Now
What’s a realistic dream? It’s a goal with a deadline. To get started now,
act now to reset your priorities.
Most of us squander our time and our money pursuing transient
pleasures. A new car, a trip to Europe, $10 lunches, TV football weekends—we waste our precious talents and resources. As a result, we suffer long-lasting regrets. But if you do today what others won’t do,
tomorrow you’ll be able to live in the enviable style that most people
will never be able to experience.
Set goals now. Precisely what goals depend on where you are today
and what you wish to achieve.
As a starting point, nearly all successful investors agree that if you
truly want to build wealth, you will set these stringent goals:
1. Dramatically cut your spending and increase your cash savings.
2. Shape up your credit proﬁle.
3. Closely read the real estate classiﬁeds in your local paper.
4. Diligently telephone sellers and go out and look at properties.
5. Join a real estate investment club.
6. Read at least ﬁve more books on real estate within the next
three months. Also read at least three books by “personal
coaches” such as Tony Robbins, Wayne Dyer, Les Brown, Shad
Helmstetter, and Maxwell Maltz.
7. Commit to making your ﬁrst real estate investment within the
next three months.

Spend Less, Save More
When Jack Holden was asked how his family got started investing in real
estate, here’s how he responded. “We scraped, borrowed, and leveraged
from every resource we had to muster the funds we needed. . . . For

ance policies. . . . The entire family went on an austerity plan to cut back
our food, travel, and entertainment expenses. Today we’re thankful we
made those early sacriﬁces.”Thankful, yes, and also wealthy. Because of
their disciplined spending, saving, and investing, the Holdens (an otherwise average family) built a real estate net worth of $4.7 million that includes not only their home equity of $600,000, but also a variety of
rental houses and small apartment buildings.
Like most people who make big money in property, the Holdens
didn’t start out with cash. As Jack Holden says, his family scrimped,
saved, leveraged, and borrowed every way they could.

Don’t Put the Car Before the Investment Property If you own a
car that’s worth nearly as much as a down payment on an investment
property, sell that car. Get rid of those big cash-draining car payments. If
your car is mostly paid for, there’s a good part of the money you need to
move up to investment property. If you’re thinking about buying a more
expensive car, stop! Until you can afford to pay cash for a new car, drive
the least expensive, dependable pre-owned car you can ﬁnd. For too
many Americans, their car is the enemy of their investment program.
Buy Your Clothes in Thrift Shops In her newspaper column, Dress
for Less, Candy Barrie writes, “I’m a big fan of these [consignment and
thrift] shops for the fashion bargains you can ﬁnd there. . . . Get on down
and you’ll discover we’re not just talking about 20, 30, or 40 percent discounts. Sometimes you can get your clothes for 90 to 95 percent off retail.”
You can save thousands on clothing expenses. Just follow Candy’s
advice: Check all the recycled, discount, and closeout clothing stores in
your area (or a nearby big city). Whatever your tastes and price range,
you’ll ﬁnd that you can slash your total clothing costs by 50 percent or
more. I regularly shop at a small, local store where the owner provides

excellent service and advice along with well-known name brands such
as L.L. Bean, Eddie Bauer, and Lands’ End, at prices 40 to 70 percent off
retail.
Don’t Buy New Furniture or Appliances As with their cars and
clothing, most would-be investors spend too much, too soon for furniture and appliances. Even worse, instead of paying cash, they charge it.
They chain themselves to several years of payments at high interest
rates. Increasingly, they are hooked into those “no payments, no interest
for six months” types of promotions that make credit purchases almost
too easy to pass up. Do yourself a favor: resist this temptation to spend
and borrow.
Whenever you buy cars, furniture, or appliances, let someone else
suffer the depreciation. Pay for the usefulness of the product. The less
money you waste on depreciating assets, the quicker you can start building wealth through real estate investments.

Shape Up Your Credit Proﬁle
Go to www.myﬁco.com and print copies of your credit reports and
credit scores. Examine your reports for errors. If you ﬁnd errors, start
the paperwork now. Correcting credit errors can require weeks—and
sometimes months.
If your debt load is too high or your payment record too slow, commit now to positive change. Reduce your balances. Pay all accounts before their due date. Fortunately, when the myﬁco computer program
calculates your credit score, the credit scorers will give your recent and
righteous credit experience more weight than your past undisciplined
credit habits. (You’ll ﬁnd many more tips on credit scoring in Chapter 3.)

Closely Read the Real Estate Classiﬁeds
When you read the real estate classiﬁeds closely, you’ll get a good feel for
the relative prices and rent levels that prevail among and within the various neighborhoods and communities in your area. In addition, you’ll spot
easy buying techniques such as lease option, owner ﬁnance, and contractfor-deed. Notice how frequently these techniques show up in the ads.

Telephone Sellers (Agents) and Look at Properties
At this preliminary stage, you’re not necessarily looking to buy—you’re
looking to learn the market. Randomly view properties. Note desirable
and undesirable features. Drive through and explore neighborhoods and
communities that are new to you. Discover how much “for sale” and “for
rent” inventory is sitting on the market. Watch trends in property selling
prices, apartment vacancy rates, and rent concessions.

Join a Real Estate Investment Club
Nearly every community offers beginning investors the opportunity to
join a locally operated apartment owners’ association or real estate investment club. In addition, in most midsized and large cities, real estate
and lending pros often offer free (or low-cost) seminars on investing and
ﬁnancing.
Attend these investment group meetings. Talk with others who
have learned the secrets of investing from years of experience. Review
and ponder the lessons they’ve learned and the trends they’re noticing.
Then, always verify what you hear with facts. Some realty pros observe
carefully and possess sharp insights. Others merely love to bluster with
ill-formed opinions—especially to an eager listener. Perfect your ability
to distinguish the sage from the braggart.

Read in the Field of Self-Improvement To follow a path of constant improvement, regularly read books in the self-help/motivational
ﬁeld. I like the work of Tony Robbins,Wayne Dyer, Les Brown, and Shad
Helmstetter. But within the broad ﬁeld of self-help I include books on
health, ﬁtness, time management, and dealing with people. If you prefer,
listen to books. You can ﬁnd nearly all self-enhancement topics on cassette tapes and compact disks. Rather than waste time when you’re driving, put those hours to productive use.
And don’t forget, browse the collection of books, CDs, and tapes at
your public library. To change your life—ﬁnancially and personally—persistently use books and tapes to improve your habits, your thinking, your
self-talk, and your performance. Your greatest power remains the power

Over the years, I’ve heard laments like this thousands of times. For

Multiple Paths to
Building Wealth
Now you’re going to see why real estate investing offers you greater opportunities to build wealth than any other type of investment. With real
estate, you can make money in dozens of different ways. For starters,
here are 16 potential paths to proﬁt:
◆ Appreciation in market values
◆ Inﬂation
◆ Cash ﬂows
◆ Mortgage payoff
◆ Buy below market
◆ Create property value
◆ Create site value
◆ Create neighborhood value

◆ Condominium conversions
◆ Improved management
◆ More-proﬁtable market strategy
◆ Tax shelter
◆ Discounted notes and tax deeds
◆ Real estate stocks (REITs, home

builders, mortgage lenders)

Appreciation in Market Values
Over periods of 5 to 10 years, nearly all types of properties gain in value
because population, jobs, incomes, and wealth (buying power) grow
faster than the amount of new construction. Over the long term, more
people with more money consistently push real estate prices up.
“Okay,” you retort,“but that was then and this is now. Surely prices
can’t continue to increase as they have in the past?” I answer,“They can

19

20

MINDSET + KNOWLEDGE = WEALTH

and they will.” To see the future, just weigh together these dominant
trends:
1. Population growth. During the next 20 years, the population of the United States will increase by 40 million people.
2. Incomes. During the next 20 years, employees, entrepreneurs, professionals, and business owners will see their incomes rise by over 50 percent.
3. Vacation homes. During the next 20 years, at least 10 million
more Americans (and foreign nationals) will choose to buy vacation homes within the United States.
4. Echo boomers. During the next 20 years, more than 60 million echo boomers (children and grandchildren of the baby
boomers) will enter the housing market to buy homes.
5. Restrictions on development. During the next 20 years,
zoning, environmental laws, building regulations, and land
shortages will continue to restrict development in those areas
where most people want to live.
6. Construction costs. During the next 20 years, the costs to
construct houses (and other types of buildings) will follow
their past trend line upward.
7. Immigrants and minorities. Currently only 40 percent of
our fastest growing immigrant and minority groups (Hispanics, blacks, Asians) own their own homes. In contrast, more
than 75 percent of whites live in homes they own. With government programs and lender outreach efforts in full swing,
during the next 20 years people in these minority and immigrant groups will continue to buy homes in record numbers.
Federal, state, and local governments in cooperation with
private lenders will be working hard to close the home ownership gap.
8. Investors. During the next 20 years, more than 60 million
baby boomers will need a retirement income. They will increasingly turn to investment real estate to meet this need. Demand for property as an investment will continue to
explode—as it has during the past 5 years.
You don’t need advanced knowledge of economics and demographics to recognize the fact that every major social trend is pushing
real estate prices upward.

Inﬂation
Each year and every year the Federal Reserve system increases the
money supply. As more money chases after a slowly increasing supply of
properties, property prices go up—even without an overall favorable
change in the underlying forces of supply and demand (market appreciation). The Federal Reserve speciﬁcally designs its
monetary policies to create a modest (1.5 to 3.0 perEven without

(CPI).

Interest Rates and Inﬂation
Journalists repeatedly perpetuate the myth that our so-called “current
historically low mortgage interest rates” have caused the recent price
run-ups in housing.

estate prices if interest rates do go up?

Higher Interest Rates Are Caused by Higher Inﬂation
Long-term interest rates climbed dramatically during the 1970s and
1980s because the Consumer Price Index (inﬂation) jumped from the
somewhat mild annual levels of 2.5 to 4.0 percent of the early to mid

22

MINDSET + KNOWLEDGE = WEALTH

1960s all the way up to 13 percent in 1982. And for the record, you
might note that during those 16 years of increasing inﬂation and skyrocketing interest rates (from 1970’s 6.0 percent to 1981’s 16 percent),
most property values nearly tripled.
Although higher inﬂation drives up interest rates, inﬂation also
drives up rent levels and construction costs. Even better for investors
who own real estate, when inﬂation heats up, the smart money ﬂees ﬁnancial assets (stocks and bonds) in favor of hard assets (real estate, gold,
collectibles). As a result, property prices are pushed even higher as stock
and bond prices stagnate or decline.
For example, in 1964, the stock market’s Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at close to 1,000. In 1981, it sat at less than 800—20 percent below its high mark of 17 years earlier. During

Say you buy today and secure a long-term mortgage interest rate of 6.5
percent. If interest rates go down, you can reﬁnance and take advantage
of lower payments (more on this topic later).

dollars. Regardless of which direction interest rates move, real estate investors (mortgage borrowers) reap the gains for themselves.

Cycling through History
Nothing I’ve written denies the hard fact of real estate cycles. Every real
estate investor knows that rent levels and property prices seldom move
upward at an even, steady pace. In some years, prices bolt ahead. In others, they merely crawl. And every now and then, short-term events (excessive job loss, temporary overbuilding) can send property prices
lower. But rather than spell doom, these cycles can be used by savvy investors to enhance their proﬁts.
Personally, I love down markets because they make buying much
easier. More important, throughout this book, I will

able opportunities—no matter what type of market
they face.

Cash Flows
Most real estate produces cash ﬂows from rent collections. Even though
today’s cash ﬂows (in many high-priced parts of the country) currently
throw off unleveraged returns of just 4 to 8 percent a year, those cash
ﬂows are sure to increase over time. When blended together, inﬂation
and market demand can push rents up an average of 3 to 5 percent a
year. Within 15 years, today’s rent level of $1,000 a month can increase
to $1,500 to $1,800 per month (or possibly more).
You also will be able to boost your cash ﬂows during periods when
interest rates decline. Say that, due to a reﬁnance at a lower interest rate,
the mortgage payment on your investment property falls from $2,000
per month to $1,700 per month. That reﬁnance just put another $300 a
month of cash ﬂow into your pocket.

24

Mortgage Payoff (Amortization)
Imagine for a moment that inﬂation ends and market demand (property
appreciation) stalls. You collect only enough rents from your property to
pay your operating expenses and mortgage payments. With stagnant
rent collections and property values, have you made a poor investment?
Not at all.
As you pay off your mortgage balance, your equity in the property
continues to grow—even without an increase in your property’s value.

Your Equity Grows Tenfold
Assume, for example, you buy a $100,000 property with a $10,000 down
payment. After 30 years, you own that property (still
valued at $100,000) free and clear. Even without

lections) alone equals an annual rate of return of 8
percent.

Amortization Alone Often Beats Other Investments
You might not think 8 percent sounds like much of a return. But it’s certainly better than bonds, annuities, certiﬁcates of deposit, and even
stocks (during many decades of our economic history). Indeed, the famous stock market bull,Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel, forecasts average stock returns over the next 10 to 20 years of just 6 to 8 percent a
year. Why? Because stocks today remain highly overvalued relative to historical norms.

years instead of 30 years, your return from paying off your property’s
mortgage would climb to an annual rate of 12 percent.

Buy Below Market Value
In real estate you can make money the moment you buy a property.
Unlike most other investments, you can buy real estate for less than its
market value. Distressed owners, owners who want to sell fast and
hassle-free, lenders who own foreclosures (called REOs), and poorly informed sellers frequently part with their properties at prices (or
terms) that immediately put dollars into your net
worth.
Bargain prices

terms) to boost their long-term proﬁts. Either way,
bargain prices ﬁll your bank accounts with money.

Create Value with Property Improvements
Most investors (and homeowners) fail to strategically improve their
properties to maximize values. As a result, entrepreneurial investors—an
investor like you who can spot opportunities for improvements—can
dramatically and quickly boost the values of the properties you buy.
Plus, when you choose to operate entrepreneurially, you also gain because your properties bring in higher rents.

Multiple Ways to Improve
When we talk about property improvement, most owners look only for
proﬁt-making cosmetic changes: Lay some new carpet, paint the walls,
clean up the yard, and put new tile ﬂoors in the kitchen and bathrooms.
As you will see, though, in Chapters 13 and 14, you can (and
should) go far beyond cosmetics. As a truly creative entrepreneurial investor, you will develop a total ﬁx-up and renovation plan that may

26

MINDSET + KNOWLEDGE = WEALTH

involve kitchen and bath remodeling, reconﬁguring a ﬂoor plan, adding
skylights or ceiling height, and attic or basement conversions.
As an entrepreneurial investor, you will survey competing properties, look for unsatisﬁed tenant (buyer) wants, and
then strategically design a plan of improvement to
Create value with

will not only add to the value of your building, you

will attract topﬂight tenants and collect higher rents.

Don’t Overlook Site Enhancement
As part of your total property improvement plan, you will also focus on
potential value improvements that you can create with the site. Maybe
you can create a view to a newly beautiﬁed backyard, add parking
spaces, eliminate a drainage problem, or even slice off part of the lot to
construct another residence.
In high-priced areas of the country, site value can easily account for
more than 50 percent of a property’s total value. When you ﬁnd better
ways to use the property’s site, you immediately boost the property’s value.
Walkways, fencing, landscaping, driveways, storage, and redevelopment
may all offer promise for proﬁt. As an alert, entrepreneurial owner, you will
think through a dozen or more potential ways to enhance site value.

Improve the Neighbors and Neighborhood
“Buy in the best neighborhood you can afford. The best neighborhoods always appreciate the fastest.” So says one of the oldest clichés in real estate.
But, in fact, it’s the turnaround neighborhoods that can often shoot up in
value the most. Throughout the United States, many once downtrodden
and shunned neighborhoods have experienced gentriﬁcation.
Although some investors wait for these neighborhoods to show strong signs of renewal, other investors jump in early while prices are still rockLook for up-andbottom cheap. They ﬁnd neighborhoods that show

Multiple Paths to Building Wealth

27

Either way, you can proﬁt big. Even during those periods when average property prices and rent levels merely edge up (level off or turn
down), some neighborhoods remain prime candidates for rapid price escalation. Turnaround neighborhoods clearly give you the chance to realize every investor’s dream,“Buy low, sell high.”

Convert the Use
From time to time some real estate markets get overbuilt with apartments, ofﬁce buildings, shopping centers, gas stations, or other types of
property. When such overbuilding occurs, alert investors go bargain
hunting. Although some bargain hunters hold for the long term, others
go for the quick proﬁts by converting properties from one use to another.
For example, New York City currently suffers from a glut of ofﬁce
space and diminishing ofﬁce building rents. In contrast, housing prices
and apartment rents continue to rise in response to New York’s perpetual shortage of homes and apartments. So, what route to proﬁts are
some New York real estate investors taking? You guessed it. They’re buying ofﬁce buildings on the cheap and converting this excess ofﬁce space
into apartments and condominiums.

Dynamic Markets Precipitate Change
When I-70 came through my hometown, slow-to-adapt motel owners
along the previously heavily traveled route U.S. 40 went broke. Alert real
estate investors, though, spotted opportunity. They bought the defunct
motels at rock-bottom prices and then proﬁtably converted them into efﬁciency apartments for the growing number of single persons within

Neighborhood Changes
For the past two decades, many close-in neighborhoods with obsolete
factories and warehouses have experienced a renaissance as real estate
investors bought cheap, old industrial buildings and converted them to
loft apartment buildings. New York City’s Soho District, San Francisco’s
South of Market (SOMA) area, and Chicago’s near north neighborhood

In the early 1990s, I worked with an investment group that bought controlling interest in defunct condominium projects. After the Texas bust
of the late 1980s, large blocks of condo units were selling for as little as
$15,000 per unit.
Yet, as apartment rentals these condo units would easily bring $350
to $425 a month. Given these sinking condo prices and relatively high
rent levels, more than a few condo projects were essentially converted
into apartment buildings. Then, when condo prices revived in the late
1990s, our investment group was able to reconvert and sell off individual
apartments at $40,000 to $60,000 per unit.

Apartments into Condos
More recently, rapidly escalating condo prices, rising vacancy rates in
apartment projects, and softening rents have encouraged increasing
numbers of investors to buy apartment buildings and convert them into
condominium developments. Similarly, facing soft ofﬁce markets, some
investors are converting ofﬁce buildings into commercial condominiums. Large numbers of doctors, lawyers, and accountants (or even other
investors) are signing up to buy them.

Always remember that as various property
prices and rent levels change, the opportunity to
convert from one use to another can yield solid gold
proﬁts. (More on this topic in Chapter 14.)

Manage and Market Your Properties More Proﬁtably
As you might suspect, most small-time investors mismanage their rental
properties. Why? Because they get lazy. They fail to keep up with
changes in the market.They fail to make desirable improvements to their
properties. They fail to develop a sound strategy of target marketing.

yields easy proﬁts.

Protect Your Proﬁts from the IRS (Tax Shelter)
To build wealth, you must protect your earnings from the greedy hand of
government. Fortunately, the income tax laws permit owners of property to escape taxation in at least four important ways:
◆ Serial home selling
◆ Section 1031 exchanges
◆ Depreciation
◆ Retirement planning

Serial Home Sellers
Growing numbers of Americans are proﬁting from investing in their
homes tax free. Here’s how it works.
Generally, when you own an investment property, you will pay a
capital gains tax on your resale proﬁts at the time you sell. However,
when you sell your personal residence, your gains come to you tax-free

up to $250,000 ($500,000 for couples). As long as you have lived in the
property for two of the previous ﬁve years, you need not even report
this proﬁt to the IRS.
Even better, you can repeat this purchase and sale every two years.

home ownership can prove to be an outstanding
method of generating relatively quick, tax-free
proﬁts. Or if you do have kids, get them involved. Put them to work.
They’ll learn some valuable lessons about real estate renovating and investing.

Section 1031 Exchanges
In addition to buying and selling a series of personal residences tax free,
you can also sell your investment properties tax free. All you need to do
is follow the rules as set forth in Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue
Code. Specialist realty pros can easily set up the necessary paperwork to
pull off these tax-free “exchanges.” I put exchange in quotations because
it’s really a misnomer. You do not actually have to trade your property
with another owner. You simply sell one property and buy another one
within a period of several months.

Depreciation
In most businesses, the IRS taxes your net cash annual income. But when
you own rental properties, you can shelter (protect) much of your cash
ﬂow from taxes by using a noncash tax deduction called depreciation.
Say your apartment building (exclusive of land
value) is worth $500,000. Your pretax cash income

lowable depreciation).

Multiple Paths to Building Wealth

31

What happens to that $18,150 deduction for depreciation if, say,
your rental property yields only $10,000 a year in pretax cash income?
In that situation, you may be able to write off (deduct) that $8,150
($18,150 depreciation less $10,000 property income) of unused “loss”
from the taxable amounts you earn from your other taxable income
(wages, business proﬁts, interest, dividends).

Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans
Do you own an IRA retirement plan? If so, you may be able to invest all
or part of it in real estate.
Unfortunately, most people believe that they can only invest these
retirement funds in corporate America’s stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or
money market accounts. Wrong! Patrick Rice fully explains these real estate investing techniques in his book, IRA Wealth: Revolutionary IRA
Strategies for Real Estate Investment (Garden City Park, N.Y., Square
One, 2003, p. 3). Here’s what Rice says:
After the sharp decline of the stock market, many of us could
only stand by and watch as our retirement savings lost their
accumulated value. Few [investors] knew that there was an alternative which offered both safety and growth. That alternative is real estate. . . . Contrary to what you may have
believed, it is possible and perfectly legal to hold real estate in
an IRA account—and to enjoy unprecedented returns.
If you have built up funds in a tax-favored retirement fund, I urge
you to talk with a ﬁnancial pro or read Rice’s book. Quite likely, you will
ﬁnd it wise to diversify at least a portion of your IRA monies into real estate. IRA funds invested in real estate build up tax free within that account just the same as would stocks, bonds, and CDs.

Taxes: Summing Up
The tax laws remain too complex for me to itemize and detail in this beginning book on investing in real estate. Nevertheless, please appreciate
the fact that, to a large degree, you can protect your real estate proﬁts
from the IRS.

MINDSET + KNOWLEDGE = WEALTH

32

To really learn how to avoid taxes on real estate, I recommend
these two books:
◆ Aggressive Tax Avoidance for Real Estate Investors, John T. Reed

(available at www.johntreed.com)
◆ Real Estate Investors Tax Guide, Vernon Hoven (Dearborn,

2003)
Throughout this book, I will focus on showing you how to make
money in real estate. In complement, Reed and Hoven show you how to
pocket these proﬁts without losing a good-sized portion to the government.

Discounted Notes, Tax Liens, Tax Deeds, and Realty Stocks
Want to make money in real estate without managing tenants or lifting a
paintbrush? Then consider the high-return business of buying (and perhaps selling) discounted notes and mortgages.

The Basics of Discounted Notes
Quite often, sellers of houses and investment properties carry back
(owner ﬁnance) some or all of their buyers’ purchase price. Buyers then
make monthly payments directly to the sellers.
After some period of time passes, a seller may decide that he or she
wants cash instead of those monthly payments. To get this cash, the
seller (note holder) sells the note to another investor—usually for an
amount somewhat less than the balance on the note owed by the buyers
of the original noteholder’s property.
For example, assume I sell you a property and

drops to, say, $21,500. I now want cash. To entice an
investor to buy this note from me, I would likely
agree to sell it for $17,500.
You might wonder,“Why sell a $21,500 mortgage for just $17,500?”
Because that’s the way this market works. In most cases, noteholders
who wish to sell must accept a discount.

Multiple Paths to Building Wealth

33

How much discount? It all depends on a number of factors. Just realize that tens of thousands of investors throughout the United States are
making outstanding returns in this ﬁeld. If you choose to, you can too.
(For a good description of this technique, see The Stefanachik Method,
Morrow, 1994.)

Tax Liens and Tax Deeds
When homeowners or real estate investors fail to pay their property taxes,
local governments place a tax lien against the property. If the taxes remain
unpaid, the government will eventually sell the property via a tax deed.
The “free and clear” infomercials of Ed Beck promise to show investors
how they can make money buying up these tax liens and tax deeds.
Although not quite so easy and risk-free as Beck’s infomercial
makes it sound, once you learn your area’s rules and procedures, you can
earn tens of thousands of dollars a year by buying these governmentissued certiﬁcates.

Stocks of REITs and Homebuilders
I strongly encourage you to directly own and manage real estate. By involving yourself directly in the real estate market, you will outearn passive investors in stocks by a long shot. Nevertheless, as one more real
estate investing alternative, you can buy the stocks issued by real estate
investment trusts (REITs) and large homebuilders such as Toll Brothers,
K&B, Lennar, and WPP. REITs are companies that own and manage large
properties such as ofﬁce buildings, shopping centers, warehouses, and
apartment complexes.

Any investor who wants to build wealth in
stocks should deﬁnitely own shares in at least several REITs and homebuilders. These companies not only offer good returns, they will reduce the overall risk of your investment portfolio. Real

Strengthen Your Credit Power

If you’re like many beginning real estate investors, you may lack substantial sums for a down payment. You may suffer from credit blemishes. Or
maybe both of these shortcomings trouble you. So, if you want to convince a lender (or property seller) to shower a huge pile of cash on
you—a total stranger—then think about your personal proﬁle the same
way a lender (seller) does:
◆ Consistency
◆ Character
◆ Credit

By far, the most important of these three Cs is Credit. With strong
credit—even without much cash or income—you will ﬁnd it easy to buy
investment real estate. Yet credit’s not the only thing that counts. If you
lack a platinum-power credit score, you can still dress yourself up for
success. Emphasize your consistent ability to perform and your sterling
character.

Consistency: Fast Track or Flake
Have you job-hopped or job-ﬂopped? Have you lived in more places than
you can remember? Did you jump through six majors before you ﬁnished community college? Do you suffer bouts of binge spending and

borrowing? Does your background look more like a tossed salad that’s
been thrown against a wall than the impeccable dinner presentation of
an expensive French restaurant? If so, you’ve got some explaining to do.
Loan representatives, loan underwriters, and sellers who offer ﬁnancing want to make sense of your life as it’s displayed on your mortgage application.1 They want to evaluate where you’ve been and where
you’re headed.

make the difference.
All in all, you want to persuade the lender, seller, or both that the
path you’re traveling is leading you toward success.

Character Counts
The famous banker, J. P. Morgan, declared,“I wouldn’t loan money to a
man I did not trust on all the bonds of Christendom.” Don’t you feel the
same way? Well, so does your lender (seller). You’ve got to convince the
lender (seller) that you’ll honor your obligations and commitments. Your
credit score provides one indicator. But, when desirable or necessary,
bolster the impression this score creates with other types of written information:
1. Employer. If your lender requires a completed VOE form
(veriﬁcation of employment), ask your supervisor to enclose a
letter that commends your dependability, integrity, and responsibility at work.

1. Throughout much of this chapter’s discussion, I will use the term “lender” to include sellers
who offer their buyers owner ﬁnancing (called OWC).

Strengthen Your Credit Power

39

2. Credit blemishes. Explain how misplaced bills, your vacation, a move of residence, or other non-character-indicting reasons account for these lapses that you deeply regret. Even
better, discuss the new bill-paying systems that you have now
put in place to prevent future lapses.
3. Credit wreck. Explain a serious problem as a once-in-alifetime, beyond-your-control event that you coped with as
honorably as possible. If your lapses really were due to irresponsibility, emphasize that “you’ve learned your lesson the
hard way” and now live well within your means. Put together
objective evidence to support your “new you” claims.
4. Personal references. In the old days of mortgage lending,
younger borrowers were awarded loans merely on the basis of
family character and reputation.2 “Why I’ve known Luke Jr.’s
family for 30 years,” the loan rep says. “They’re great people.
Loan approved.” Now, in our big-city, automated world, personal references to lenders seldom count for much. Still, if
you’ve established good rapport with people who

proval. You need never suffer the claw marks of
predatory (hard money) lenders.
In contrast, if you do need to improve your credit score, here’s the
knowledge you will need to gain that platinum-power borrowing status.

What Is Credit Scoring?
Through credit scoring, lenders try to minimize individual human judgment in the mortgage lending decision. Credit scoring data with auto
loans, department store accounts, and credit cards proves that computer
statistical programs can distinguish among platinum, gold, copper, lead,
and plastic borrowers far better than back-ofﬁce loan clerks or frontofﬁce loan reps.
To create these credit scoring programs, math whizzes study the
credit proﬁles, borrowing habits, and payback records of hundreds of
thousands of people. Then they search for statistically signiﬁcant correlations that tend to rate borrowers along a continuum from “walks on
water” (say, 800 or higher) to “let’s pray they drown” (say, 500 or lower).
Supposedly, credit scores may range from 350 to 900, but more than 75
percent of Americans fall within the range of 600 to 800.

Credit Scoring Spreads Its Inﬂuence
If you’ve received a preapproved credit card in the mail, or obtained instant credit at Sears, Home Depot, or Best Buy, you’ve been run through
a credit scoring program. That’s why the store could make the credit decision so quickly with only minimal information from you (Social Security number, name, address). Even insurance companies (especially auto
and homeowners) are now turning to credit scores to decide whether to

Contrary to what many loan reps (and others) believe, your credit score doesn’t necessarily represent
your credit strength. You may never have paid a bill
late in your life and still earn a credit score of less
than 660.

Credit Scoring Doesn’t Rate You Personally The credit scorers select certain characteristics that you share with others who have (or have
not) paid their bills as scheduled. Then, based on these selected characteristics, the scorer’s mathematical formula assigns you a number. Supposedly, this assessment accurately gauges the risks you present to the lender.
But it doesn’t. Why? Because you are a unique individual. Although you
share some similarities with this computer sample of debtors, you also differ in many ways of which the credit scoring programs have no knowledge. These unaccounted-for differences may give you far more (or far
less) borrowing credibility than your credit score indicates.
You can easily see the parallel here with SAT scores and other college
admission tests. If you fail to register a top score, you can kiss Stanford
goodbye—unless, that is, you write a superlative admissions essay and beef
up your application with science fair awards and club presidencies.
You’re Not Just a Number Remember Bob Seger’s classic hit, “Feel
Like a Number”? When you apply for mortgage credit, don’t let the

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

42

lender make you feel like a number. Yes, do all that you can to boost your
credit score. But never let a lender (or seller) confuse the total you with
your credit score.3 By the same token, never assume that your astute loan
rep and underwriter will intuitively recognize your worthwhile qualities.
Just as the aspiring Stanford applicant must document why she deserves
admission, you, too, must persuasively document why the lender (seller)
can trust you to pay back that $250,000 you’re trying to ﬁnance.

Discover Your Credit Scores
To discover your credit scores, go to www.myﬁco.com. There you can
see (for a fee) all of your credit reports (Trans Union, Experian, Equifax).
Each report will also include an associated credit score.
The three scores provided for you may not vary much from each
other. But sometimes they do. That’s because Equifax, Experian, and TU
don’t share credit data with each other. Different credit data yield different credit scores. Big differences in credit bureau data may yield big differences in each of the credit scores they assign you.

Want to Save Money?
If you don’t want to spend the money to obtain credit information,
you’ve got several other choices:
1. Mortgage loan sites. Some mortgage websites will provide
you a free, no obligation credit score that simulates, but
doesn’t precisely mirror, the Equifax-FICO score (trade-named
Beacon). However, I have found that these free simulated
scores do not provide consistent results, nor do their scores
accurately mimic your FICO scores. Because most mortgage
lenders use FICO scores, simulated FICO ﬁgures provide little
useful information.
2. Consumerinfo.com. This website operated by Experian will
give you a free credit report, but it also will automatically en-

43

roll you in a $79.95 credit-monitoring service. Cancel this service within 30 days and you owe nothing.
3. Free reports. Various states require credit bureaus to provide
reports for free (or at nominal cost). Also, under federal law
you may receive free reports from each of the credit repositories if (1) you’re unemployed and looking for work, (2) you’re
on welfare, or (3) you’ve been turned down for credit during
the past 30 days.
4. General commentary. For the latest (usually critical) commentary about credit scoring and credit reporting, go to
www.creditscoring.com and www.creditaccuracy.com. Also,
the Federal Trade Commission maintains consumer information on all types of credit issues at www.ftc.gov.

How You Can Improve Your Credit Score
Credit scorers place your credit data into their computer programs and
out pops a number. But they won’t tell you precisely how they calculated that ﬁgure. However, after you’ve paid your fee at myﬁco.com, the
website info will give you some pointers on how to improve your Beacon®-FICO® score. To learn how much your score actually does improve (if any) over the next 12 months, you will need to pay another fee.
For that cost, you get four more periodic Beacon®-FICO® reports.
Unfortunately, the information provided by FICO still doesn’t go far
enough. It’s more like,“try this (really, pay us) to see what happens.”You
really can’t tell ahead of time the speciﬁc score boost that suggested
changes might bring about. Nevertheless, piecing together clues from
myﬁco.com and several helpful loan reps, here are some good tips on
how to raise your credit scores:
1. Number of open credit accounts. You can have too few or
too many. The optimum number probably ranges between
four and six. One highly paid, credit perfect (no lates) executive I know scored 640. After closing the 6 newest of her 12
credit card accounts, her score went to 780. (But it took six
months before her score climbed up to that level.)
2. Balances. Open accounts with balances reduce your score
more than open accounts per se.

44

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

3. Balances/limits. Numerous accounts with balances sitting
close to the limit will bring down your score.
4. Credit inquiries. Whenever someone checks your credit ﬁle,
it counts against your score. However, multiple checks within,
say, two weeks may not hurt as much as if it appears that
you’re merely shopping different lenders for one loan. Your
personal inquiries don’t affect your score.
5. Payment record. Obviously, late payments hurt your score.
But, supposedly FICO doesn’t distinguish between late mortgage payments and late payments on your Visa or student
loan. (Mortgage lenders, though, most certainly do care. Always pay your mortgage or rent ﬁrst.)
6. Recency counts. Late payments two years ago don’t hurt as
much as two months ago.
7. Black marks. Multiple lates on multiple accounts, collections, unpaid judgments, and tax liens devastate your score.
8. Kiss of death. Go straight to credit scoring purgatory if
you’re within two years of a past bankruptcy discharge or a
foreclosure sale. Chapter 13 bankruptcy plans and credit
counseling debt management plans also count heavily and
negatively.
Myﬁco.com also shows that some categories weigh more than others:
◆ Age of credit (15 percent)
◆ Mix of credit (10 percent)
◆ Amount of balances (30 percent)
◆ Payment history (35 percent)
◆ Recent credit inquiries (10 percent)

The above clues shed some light on the credit scoring process, but far
too little. Perhaps most importantly, they do show why “perfect credit”in
the sense of “no lates” does not necessarily generate the highest FICO
score. To improve your score, you must not only pay your bills on time
but also manage your credit according to the likes and dislikes of the
FICO (or other) credit-scoring programs.
Garbage In, Garbage Out Computer data researchers everywhere
know of GIGO (garbage in, garbage out). Clearly, this saying also applies
to credit reporting. Credit scoring computer programs pull in raw data

Strengthen Your Credit Power

45

from the ﬁles of Equifax,Trans Union, or Experian. If your credit ﬁles include errors (as do at least 50 percent of all ﬁles), then your credit scores
also will err.

and mistakes can slow down or derail your
mortgage approval.
What to Look For You’re looking for errors, but what kinds of errors?
More than you might think:
1. Inconsistency. Evaluate whether your three reports differ
signiﬁcantly from each other. Does each report accurately
show your credit accounts along with an appropriate “open”
or “closed”?
2. Late payments. Make sure that all late payments shown
were in fact lates. Also, check the category of lates 30, 60, and
90 days or over. Sometimes creditors overstate the number of
days a payment has been late. Watch for rolling lates; you miss
a payment, then get back on schedule. Every subsequent payment may show up as late.
3. Balances. Verify that the outstanding balances and credit limits don’t misstate your true credit position. Remember, when
balances push against limits, your credit score goes down.
4. Disputed claims. Have you justiﬁably refused to pay any
creditor’s bills? Health clubs (and other service contract
providers) often continue to bill (and report unpaid) fees for
membership that customers canceled long ago.
5. Credit experience counts. Do the reports accurately indicate the length of time each account has been opened?
6. Omissions. Have you established excellent credit with a
credit card, landlord, or retail merchant that does not show
up in your credit ﬁles? Some creditors withhold excellent

payment records and balance information. Why? If your credit
score goes up, that lender’s competitors will start mailing you
offers to switch to their better terms or higher limits.
Tax liens. This type of claim nearly always must be paid before your mortgage loan closes.
Judgments. Ditto for judgments unless the statute of limitations has passed.
Collections/write-offs. For collections and write-offs,
lenders may require that you settle them. Or the lender might
calculate your qualifying total debt ratio as if you were paying
5 percent of these delinquent balances each month. If you
combine a high current credit score with write-offs more than
ﬁve years old, the lender may simply ignore them.
Time limits. See if any derogatory information shows up in
violation of these legal time limits: credit inquiries (2 years);
foreclosure (7 years); lates, collections, write-offs (7 years);
judgments and tax liens (usually until statute of limitations
runs out). To calculate “time limits,” work back from the “date
of last activity” on the debt. Also, creditors often sell their bad
debts to credit vultures. These outﬁts may report debts beyond their lawful date of removal. Beware: You can trigger a
new time limit by partial payment or settlement. Bankruptcy
starts the clock on the date of discharge, not ﬁling. Also, for
larger loans, these time limits may not apply.
Other information. Verify all other information such as
names, addresses, employment, date of birth, and so on.
Consistency with application. Remember, your loan underwriter will likely verify the data in your credit ﬁles with the liabilities and other information you list on your mortgage
application. Do they match up?

What to Do Next
Should you discover errors, omissions, or inconsistencies that push
down on your credit score, act immediately to correct them. If you
wait until a loan rep inquires about these derogatory entries, you could
lose your loan and the property you have agreed to buy. Some problems can disappear in a matter of days, but others may take months to
clear up.

Strengthen Your Credit Power

Contact the Credit Source and the Credit Repository Simultaneously Most credit advisors tell you to notify the credit repository,
point out the change you deserve, and formally (in writing) seek compliance with your request. Good advice except for one critical fact: Credit
repositories primarily report only the information your creditors give
them. Unless the repository has botched the data it’s been given (which
does happen), the repository must contact the misreporting creditor. If
the creditor does not respond within 30 days, the repository must remove the disputed item.
However, if the creditor says, “Sorry, no mistake on our part,” the
record remains as is. The problem’s back in your lap—but now 30 days
may have passed by. To head off this potential delay, contact the original
source of the information simultaneously and ask to have new, corrected
info sent to the repository. Upon request

could face a prolonged battle. In that case,
the loan underwriter will either waive the
“derog” upon suitable explanation from you; offer you a higher-cost, lessdesirable loan; or ﬂat out suspend commitment until you obtain the
creditor’s correction or release.
To get their mortgage closed on schedule, many borrowers have
had to pay disputed claims. Acting early prevents forced settlements on
eat-crow terms. So carefully review your credit reports now. Avoid getting into a borrowing situation where you’re offering last-minute pleas
under deadline conditions.

Your spouse or
partner’s low
credit score can
squelch your loan
approval.

Multiple Borrowers, Multiple Scores When
you and your spouse (or other coborrower) want to
buy and ﬁnance an investment property, all borrowers will need credit scores (or explanations) that
equal or exceed lender minimums. Without meeting this requirement, the low-score borrower must
withdraw as a coborrower. The lender will then
limit the loan amount to the qualifying capacity of
the high-score borrower.

You can work around this problem, though, when you buy an income property. You can bring in another person with strong credit (parent, partner, sibling, friend) to serve as cosignor or coborrower. Be
cautious, though. If you don’t make the loan payments on time, the
lender will report these late payments to the credit repositories (Experian, Equifax,Trans-Union). The derogs will show up in your ﬁle. But they
will also count against the credit record and credit score of your coborrower or cosignor.
One Borrower, Multiple Credit Scores Now, here’s a question you
need to consider. When your credit records show different credit scores,
which score will the lender choose to use if one of your scores falls
below the lender’s cutoff point? To a certain extent,
it will depend on the persuasive story you tell about
yourself and the reported discrepancies. In other inWhen they differ,

Your Ex-Spouse Can Ruin Your Credit (and Other Tales of DoubleCounting)
Are you divorced, married, or planning to wed? Might you buy a property with a partner or signiﬁcant other? Then you’re going to face the
multiple-score, multiple-person problem of credit scoring and mortgage
approval.
The Ex-Spouse Dilemma If a competent lawyer handled your divorce, you should have cut up all joint credit cards and closed all joint accounts. If you and you ex-spouse owned a home

Your Ex-Spouse Can Ruin Your Credit Even worse than debt overload (for purposes of mortgage approval), your ex-spouse’s poor repayment habits on joint debts will show up to bruise your credit. These
same types of problems can also confront married couples who are separated (either legally or by informal agreement). When ending your personal lives together, abolish all joint credit accounts. Sometimes a lender
will permit you to explain away poor credit where the full responsibility
actually falls on your ex, but the lender will not overlook joint credit obligations that remain open. When the law imposes legal liability on you
for the debt, then as far as the lender’s concerned, it’s your debt. Or it’s
your credit line for as long as it remains open or unpaid. The lesson: Get
rid of all joint accounts that do not result from a current, trusting, continuing relationship.

Summing Up
For the top 20 to 30 percent of U.S. investors, credit scoring and automated underwriting greatly ease the pain of ﬁnancing a home or investment property. On the other hand, if you’re a borrower without
platinum-power credit (say a FICO score below 720), to improve your
credit score you must do something more than “pay your bills on time.”
You must align your credit behavior with FICO (or other credit scoring
systems). You (and your coborrowers) will achieve the lowest interest
rates, highest loan amounts, best terms, and least hassle only when you
play the credit game according to the rules laid down by these new sultans of mortgage credit. The higher you lift your credit score, the greater
your borrowing power.

It’s true. You can proﬁt in real estate without much cash—especially
if you’ve strengthened your credit score. But even when you lack
platinum-power credit, you’ve still got a variety of little-or-no-cash-down
techniques that you can draw on to get you started as a real estate investor.

Why Low-Cash Deals Magnify Your Returns
Before we go into little-or-no-cash-down techniques, you need to see
why deals with small down payments can magnify your returns. Even if
you’re hoarding a pile of cash, you may still choose to hang onto your
money as you beneﬁt from the power of leverage.

The Power of Leverage
Leverage (other people’s money, commonly referred to as OPM) means
that you buy (or otherwise control) a property that’s worth perhaps 10
times as much as your original cash investment. To illustrate, suppose
you invest $10,000 in a $100,000 rental property. You ﬁnance this investment with a 30-year, $90,000 mortgage at 7.75 percent. After eight
years you will have paid down your mortgage balance to $81,585. With
4 percent a year appreciation for eight years, your property’s value will

you gained a return six times larger than the 4 percent rate of appreciation. Now you see why real estate investors call leverage the eighth

money to acquire and ﬁnance their property investments.

Leverage Can Also Magnify Your Annual Cash Returns
In addition to multiplying your proﬁts from appreciation, leverage magniﬁes your annual returns from cash ﬂows. Say you ﬁnd a seller who is
asking $100,000 for a rental property that yields a net operating income
(called NOI) of $10,000 a year. If you paid all cash for this property, you
would receive a return of 10 percent:
Example 1: $100,000 all-cash purchase
Income (NOI)
Cash investment
$10, 000
=
$100, 000

ROI (return on investment) =

= 10%

Now let’s say that you also want to compare your all-cash returns to
those you would receive using 75 percent and 90 percent ﬁnancing, respectively. Assume that you can borrow money at 6.5 percent and pay it
back over a term of 30 years. Here’s how leverage boosts your annual returns from cash ﬂow.
Example 2: $25,000 down payment; $75,000 ﬁnanced. Yearly
mortgage payments equal $6,607 (75 � $7.34 � 12). Net cash ﬂow after
mortgage payments (called cash throw-off) equals $3,394 ($10,000 NOI
less $6,606).
ROI =

$3, 394
$25, 000

Example 3: $10,000 down payment; $90,000 ﬁnanced. Yearly
mortgage payments equal $7,927 (90 � $7.34 � 12). Net cash ﬂow after
mortgage payments (cash throw-off) equals $2,073 ($10,000 NOI less
$7,927).
ROI =

With the ﬁgures in these examples, the highly leveraged ﬁnancing
(10 percent down payment) yields a cash-on-cash rate of return more than
double that of a cash purchase. In principle, the more

Leverage Can Increase Risk
Savvy investors reap the beneﬁts of leverage. Foolish investors can lose
their shirts. What makes the difference? Financial discipline and cash reserves.
Financial Discipline If you can’t handle money responsibly, borrowing to the hilt can swamp you with debt. Never try to substitute “nothing
down” for ﬁnancial discipline. It doesn’t work that way. As I emphasize

you must successfully navigate through the storms
you’ll encounter along the way. When high seas are

With these words of caution now in view, we next turn to the best
type of high-leverage ﬁnancing currently available.
Always keep a

Minimize Your Down Payment with Owner-Occupant Financing
By far, the easiest, safest, surest, and lowest cost way to borrow all (or
nearly all) of the money you need to invest in real estate centers upon
owner-occupied mortgage ﬁnancing. In other words, lenders give their
most favored interest rates and terms to investors and homebuyers who
live in their properties (for a minimum of 12 months). Numerous high
LTV (loan-to-value) owner-occupied loan programs are readily available
for single-family homes, condominiums, townhouses, and two- to fourunit apartment buildings.

Owner-Occupants Get the Lowest Down Payments
Many owner-occupied loan programs offer 3 percent, 5 percent, or even
0 percent down payment loans. With sterling credit, some lenders will
even loan you 125 percent of a property’s purchase price (if you agree
to live in the property). In contrast, if you do not plan to live in the property, many mortgage lenders (banks, mortgage bankers, savings institutions) often require investors to put 20 or 30 percent down. However,
since the late 1990s, some lenders have allowed investors to ﬁnance
their rental properties with only a 5 or 10 percent down payment. When
property markets soften, though, these liberal lenders will probably shut
their easy credit windows and force investors to put more cash into
their deals and dance through more hoops.
Besides offering low-down-payment ﬁnancing, lenders also qualify
owner-occupants with less exacting standards. Plus, interest rates for
owner-occupants can sit below the rate charged for investor loans. If

How to Invest Using Little (or None) of Your Own Cash

55

lenders are charging, say, 5.5 to 6.5 percent for loans to owner-occupants
with strong credit, the rate for most creditworthy investor loans will
probably range between 6.75 and 7.5 percent. As a beginning real estate
investor, you deﬁnitely should explore owner-occupied mortgage loans.

Owner-Occupied Buying Strategies
If you don’t currently own a home, you can begin building your wealth
in income properties very easily. Simply select a low-down-payment loan
program that appeals to you (the most popular ones are described later
in this chapter). Buy a one- to four-family property, live in it for (at least)
one year, then rent out your living unit and repeat
the process. Once you get your owner-occupied ﬁnancing, that loan can remain on a property even

ties as well as your own residence—all without
large cash investments.
Although you will be able to go through this process two, three,
maybe four times, you can’t execute it indeﬁnitely. At some point,
lenders will shut you off from owner-occupied ﬁnancing because they
will catch on to your game plan. Nevertheless, buying houses (or 2–4
unit apartment buildings) and holding on to them as you successively
move in and move out makes a great way to accumulate your ﬁrst several investment properties.

Current Homeowners, Too, Can Use This Method
You may already
own an

property—your
own home.

Even if you already own a home, you too should
deﬁnitely weigh the advantages of using owneroccupied ﬁnancing to acquire your next several
properties. Here’s how: Locate a property (condominium, house, 2–4 unit apartment building) that
you can buy and move into. Find a good tenant for
your current home. Complete the owner-occupied
ﬁnancing on your new property and move into it. If

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

56

you really like your current home, at the end of one year, rent out your
recently acquired investment property and move back into your former
residence. Or alternatively, ﬁnd another “home” to buy and again ﬁnance
this property with an owner-occupied mortgage.

Why One Year?
To qualify for owner-occupied ﬁnancing you must tell the lender that
you intend to live in the property for at least a year. Intent, though, does
not mean guarantee. You can (for good reason, or no reason) change
your mind. The lender will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to prove that you falsely stated
your intent at the time you applied for the loan.
Nevertheless, to succeed in real estate over the short and long term,
you must establish, maintain, and nurture your credibility with lenders—
and everyone else. Always build your deal making on a foundation of
trust. When you sidestep agreements, slip through loopholes, make false
promises, or connive in any similar slights, you will
water down your credibility. Unless you really do enNever ﬁb to a

attract money as a magnet attracts iron ﬁlings.

Where Can You Find Low-Down-Payment, High-LTV, Owner-Occupied
Mortgages?
Everywhere! Look through the yellow section of your telephone book
under “mortgages.” Then start calling banks, savings institutions, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, and credit unions. Also, many mortgage
lenders advertise in local daily newspapers.1 Check, too, with your state,
county, or city departments of housing ﬁnance. Homebuilders and Realtors also will know various types of low- or nothing-down home ﬁnance
programs. An hour or two on the telephone will turn up dozens of possibilities.

mortgages.

Don’t Overlook FHA

FHA does not
restrict its loans to
low- or moderateincome
individuals.

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers
the most well-known low-down-payment home ﬁnance plans. Yet, somewhat perversely, many homebuyers believe that FHA limits its loans to people
who earn low or moderate incomes. For instance,
one of Florida’s largest newspapers continues to describe FHA as a program for “low-income homebuyers.” Not true. No matter how much you earn, FHA
may provide the key to your home ﬁnancing.

FHA 203(b)
When Realtors and mortgage lenders talk about an FHA loan, they are
typically referring to the FHA 203(b) mortgage. With close to 1 million
new FHA 203(b) loans made last year alone, this program is the largest
single low-down-payment loan available throughout the United States.
You can get into this type of FHA mortgage for just 3 or 5 percent
out-of-pocket cash—sometimes a little more, sometimes less. On an
$85,000 property you would pay around $3,250. To ﬁnance a $125,000
property you’d pay approximately $6,000, and a property priced at
$175,000 would require cash of around $8,250.

How Much Will FHA Finance?
FHA sets loan limits for each locale around the country. In high-priced
cities such as Los Angeles, San Diego, Washington, D.C., and Boston, the
FHA maximum loan currently tops out (for single-family houses, condos, and townhomes) at $290,319. In the lowest priced areas of the
country, the maximum FHA home loan comes in at $160,176. Because
FHA limits vary, consult with a Realtor or mortgage loan advisor in the

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

58

area where you would like to own. Then compare these limits to property prices to see if FHA 203(b) can work for you. (Note: Much higher
FHA limits apply in Hawaii. You can also check the maximum loan
amounts for any county in the country at HUD.gov.)

Buy Rental Properties
As another choice, buy a duplex, triplex, or fourplex. As long as you live
in one of the units, you still get a low down payment. Here are some examples of maximum FHA loan ﬁgures for 2–4 unit properties:

Two units

If you buy a 2–4 unit property, you won’t have to
qualify for the loan using just your monthly earnings. The rents that you collect from the property
also will count. Because my ﬁrst investment property was a ﬁve-unit apartment house, I strongly favor
this approach to getting started.

Other FHA Advantages
Besides offering a low down payment, FHA borrowers enjoy many other
advantages:
1. You can roll many of your closing expenses and mortgage insurance premiums into your loan. This cuts the out-of-pocket
cash you’ll need at closing.
2. You may choose from either ﬁxed-rate or adjustable-rate FHA
plans. (FHA adjustable-rate mortgages give you lower annual
caps and lower lifetime caps than most other ARM programs.)
3. FHA authorizes banks and other lenders to use higher qualifying ratios and easier underwriting guidelines (see Chapter 5).

How to Invest Using Little (or None) of Your Own Cash

59

After you’ve shaped up your ﬁnances, FHA will do all it can to
approve your loan.
4. If interest rates drop (and as long as you have a clean mortgage payment record for the previous 12 months), you can
“streamline” reﬁnance your FHA loan at lower interest rates
without a new property appraisal and without having to requalify.
5. If you can persuade your parents or other close relatives to
“gift” you the down payment, you won’t need to come up with
any closing-table cash from your own pocket. (Undoubtedly,
many “gifted” down payments are really loans in disguise.)
6. Unlike most nongovernment loans, FHA mortgages are assumable. Someone who later agrees to buy your home need not
apply for a new mortgage. When mortgage interest rates are
high, an assumable low-rate FHA mortgage will give your
home a great selling advantage.

The Verdict on FHA 203(b)

deﬁnitely consider the FHA 203(b) ﬁnance plan. The

Discover FHA’s Best Kept Secret: The 203(k) Program
Like many renters, Quentlin Henderson of Orlando, Florida, hoped to invest in real estate some day. Yet, with little savings, Quentlin thought he
wouldn’t realize his hopes for at least three to four years. He never
dreamed that within six months he would actually own a completely
renovated, three-bedroom, two-bath house of 2,288 square feet—more

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

60

than two and a half times as large as his previous 900-square-foot apartment.
How did Quentlin manage this feat? He discovered the little
known, but increasingly available, FHA 203(k) mortgage loan program.
FHA 203(k) allows owner-occupant investors to acquire and improve a
rundown property with a low- or no-down-payment loan. “The house
needed a new roof, new paint, new carpeting; and a bad pet odor needed
to be removed,” says Quentlin. “There was no way I could have paid for
the house plus the repairs at the same time. And there was no way I
could have otherwise afforded a house this size.”

Locate an FHA 203(k) Specialist
To use a 203(k) plan, ﬁrst locate a mortgage loan advisor who understands the current FHA 203(k) purchase and improvement process. In
the past, FHA often stuck borrowers in red tape for months without end.
But now with recent FHA streamlining and special software, Robert
Arrowwood of California Financial Corporation reports that up-to-date,
direct endorsement (DE) ﬁrms like his can “close 203(k) loans in four to
six weeks instead of four to six months.” (HUD lists 203(k) specialists on
its website at HUD.gov.)

Search for Good Value
After you’ve located 203(k) advisors who know what they’re doing, next
search for a property that offers good value for the money. In Quentlin
Henderson’s case, his Realtor found him a bargainpriced, six-year-old house that was in a sorry state

erally low so that after repairs are made, the home’s
new value often produces instant equity.”
Not surprisingly, the term “instant equity” was also used by John
Evianiak, a 203(k) investor in Baltimore. “Not only can you buy a house
and ﬁx it the way you like,” John says,“but you can buy a property for

How to Invest Using Little (or None) of Your Own Cash

61

much below its market value, put some money into it, and create instant
equity. There were a lot of other houses we checked out. But we were
going by the proﬁt margin.”

Inspect, Design, Appraise
Once you locate a property that you ﬁgure can be bought and rehabbed
proﬁtably, you next must come to terms with the owners on price and
other conditions of sale. With agreement in hand, the house (or condo or
2–4 unit apartment) is then inspected, a formal plan of repair and renovation is designed, and the home is appraised according to its value after
your improvements have been completed. The amount of your loan is
based upon your purchase price plus your rehab expenses up to around
100 percent of the property’s renovated value.

Eligible Properties and Improvements
As long as you plan to pay more than $5,000 in rehab expenses, you can
use a 203(k) mortgage to acquire and improve nearly any one- to fourunit property. In terms of speciﬁc repairs and renovations, the 203(k)
mortgage permits an almost endless list of possibilities. Here are some
examples:
◆ Install skylights, ﬁreplaces, energy-efﬁcient items, or new appli-

ances (stove, refrigerator, washer, dryer, trash compactor, dishwasher).
◆ Finish off an attic or basement.
◆ Eliminate pollution or safety hazards (lead paint, asbestos, underground storage tanks).
◆ Add living units such as an accessory apartment or two.
◆ Recondition or replace plumbing, roof, or HVAC systems.
◆ Improve aesthetic appeal (paint, carpet, tile, exterior siding).
◆ Install or replace a well or septic system.
◆ Landscape and fence the yard.
As you can see, the FHA 203(k) program can really help you increase the value of a property—using little or none of your own cash.

Too Many Vets Pass Up VA Loans
If you’re a veteran with eligible active military service, or if you have
served at least six years in the reserves, the Department of Veterans Affairs holds your ticket to nothing-down investing. The VA mortgage is
truly one of the best beneﬁts offered to those who have worn our country’s uniform. Last year alone, a record 600,000 veterans took advantage
of this loan program. Here are several of the great beneﬁts you’ll get with
a VA mortgage.
◆ No

down payment. With a VA loan you can ﬁnance up to
$240,000 without putting any money down. If you want to buy a
higher-priced property, you need only come up with 25 percent of
the amount over $240,000. For instance, if the property you want
to buy is priced at $300,000, you’ll need a down payment of
$15,000 (0.25 � $60,000)—or just 5 percent of the purchase
price.
◆ Liberal qualifying. Similar to FHA,VA loans offer liberal qualifying guidelines. Many (but not all) VA lenders will forgive properly explained credit blemishes. The VA loan also permits higher
qualifying ratios. I’ve seen veterans with good compensating factors close loans with a 0.48 total debt ratio. (See Chapter 8.)
◆ Closing costs paid. Often homebuilders and cooperative sellers will pay all of the veteran’s settlement expenses. In fact,
builders sometimes advertise that veterans can buy homes in
their developments for just $1 total move-in costs.
◆ 2–4 unit properties. As with FHA loans, VA will ﬁnance a single-family house or an owner-occupied 2–4 unit property. However, unlike FHA,VA does not raise its lending limits for duplexes,
triplexes, and quads.
◆ Assumable. Like FHA, a non-vet buyer may assume your VA
mortgage when you sell your home. Also like FHA, if interest
rates fall you can streamline a no-appraisal, no-qualifying reﬁnance.
◆ No mortgage insurance. But unlike FHA, when you use a VA
loan, you won’t have to buy mortgage insurance. You will have to
pay a one-time “funding fee” ranging between 1.5 to 2.75 percent
of the amount you borrow. If you don’t want to pay this fee in cash
at closing, you can tell the lender to add it to your mortgage loan
balance.

Even Fannie and Freddie Accept Little- or Nothing-Down Loans
Conventional

(nongovernment
loans) now offer
multiple types of
low-downpayment loans.

In the mid 1990s, both Freddie Mac (see www.
homesteps.com) and Fannie Mae (www.fanniemae.
com) have committed to making far more little- or
nothing-down loan programs available. Since then, in
addition to their standard 5 percent down loan product, Fannie and Freddie have pioneered community
homebuyer programs, 3 percent down loans, and now
even 103 percent LTV loans—meaning qualiﬁed borrowers can go through closing with almost no cash
out of their own pocket. For a full view of Fannie/
Freddie programs, visit these companies’ websites.

Tougher Credit Standards and Lower-Cost Private Mortgage Insurers
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac low-down-payment loans do apply tougher
credit standards than either FHA or VA, but their loan limits reach substantially higher. Also, borrowers whose credit scores top 680 (possibly
620) will probably pay less for private mortgage insurance with these
loan programs than they would with FHA.
On the other hand, borrowers with FICO scores of less than 620
may ﬁnd that FHA’s mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) now fall below
the premiums of the private insurers who guarantee Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac’s low-down-payment mortgages (LTVs greater than 80

up their costs to give marginal borrowers a real wallop—an increase of
nearly $200 per month on a $200,000 mortgage.

Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Loan Limits
Unlike FHA loans, the maximum amount you can borrow under Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae programs does not vary by area of the country—except for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, where
loan limits are 50 percent higher than the continental United States.
Generally, Freddie and Fannie loan limits are high enough to ﬁnance
good properties in decent neighborhoods. Freddie Mac and Fannie
Mae programs will lend up to the following amounts (adjusted upward
each year):

As you can see, a Fannie or Freddie low-down-payment loan can get
you a property valued in excess of $650,000. Remember, too, all you
need to do is move into the property for a minimum of 12 months. What

Summing Up
Whether you currently rent or own, if you’re cash-short, I urge you to seriously consider the advantages of ﬁnancing your next investment property with a low- or no-down-payment owner-occupied loan. In fact, even
if the amount of your bank balance climbs up to six ﬁgures or more, remember the great (potential) beneﬁts of high leverage. Whatever your ﬁ-

owner-occupied ﬁnancing.
But if you can’t or don’t want to go for this type of easy ﬁnancing,
take heart. You’ve still got many other low- or no-cash possibilities. For
those techniques, we now turn to Chapter 5.

Forget the Banks, Seek Out
Seller Financing

Robert Bruss, the nationally syndicated columnist, real estate attorney,
and investor, was recently asked,“Where’s the best place to get a mortgage? At a bank, savings and loan, or credit union?” He answered,“None
of these is the best. The best source of ﬁnancing is the seller.” If you can
persuade the sellers to help with your ﬁnancing, you’ll probably get
many of the following beneﬁts:
1. Little (or nothing) down. Although some sellers do insist
on a 20 or 30 percent down payment, most owners who offer
OWC (owner-will-carry) ﬁnancing will accept 10 percent
down (or less).
2. Lower credit standards. Although banks have made qualifying easier, they’re still tougher than most sellers.
3. No qualifying income. As we discuss in Chapter 8, many
sellers expect you to pay their monthly payments from the income the property produces rather than use their own earnings. As long as your rent collections look like they’re enough
to cover all of your expenses, the seller won’t usually ask for
your W-2s or income tax returns (as will a bank).
4. Flexibility. Price, interest rate, monthly payments, and other
terms are set by mutual agreement. You and the sellers can
put together a ﬁnancing package in any way that works for
both of you.
66

Forget the Banks, Seek Out Seller Financing

67

5. Lower closing costs. Sellers seldom require points, origination fees, and loan application costs. Unlike lending institutions, sellers don’t have to cover ofﬁce overhead.
6. Less paperwork. Although sellers may ask for your credit
scores, they won’t require a stack of forms, documents, and
veriﬁcations.
7. Quicker sale. Seller ﬁnancing can help sellers get their property sold more quickly. Plus, for properties that require extensive repairs or renovations, seller ﬁnancing can make the
difference between a sale and no sale.
The types of seller-assisted ﬁnancing that you might use to buy a
property are as varied as your imagination. But be aware, not all owners
who will accept (OWC) ﬁnancing advertise that
fact. Indeed, Robert Bruss says, “I’ve bought many

accept it.
Although many sellers do advertise, Bruss is
right. Regardless of whether sellers state their intention to carry back ﬁnancing, keep the possibility in mind. You won’t
know for sure until you’ve written up an offer.
For numerous examples of seller-assisted ﬁnancing that I’ve
reprinted from the pages of recent newspapers, see Box 5.1. Look
through your local papers. More than likely you’ll ﬁnd many similar
types of ads. And even if you don’t, never fear to make seller ﬁnancing a
part of your offer.

Sellers Can Nearly Always Beat the Banks at Their Own Game, But
You Must Do More than Ask
Here are the differences: Mortgage lenders operate by bureaucratic
rules. Sellers are free to listen to any deal you suggest that provides them
worthwhile beneﬁts. Lenders may require qualiﬁcations, paperwork,
documents, and veriﬁcations piled higher and deeper. Sellers can agree
to as few documents and qualifying standards as reasonable in a speciﬁc
situation. Lenders pay huge costs for fancy buildings, ofﬁce overhead,

incur none of these expenses. In addition to interest, lenders may charge you thousands of dollars in
origination fees, closing costs, and mortgage insurance. Sellers expect payment only for interest and
maybe a few out-of-pocket costs.

How to Get the Sellers Interested
If you simply pop the question to sellers out of the blue and ask them to
carry back ﬁnancing, many will answer with a quick no. So, always put
your proposal in writing as part of your offer to buy the property. Don’t
necessarily expect oral concessions on this issue right away. (Prior to
writing an offer, I do frequently pose feeler questions such as,“Have you given any thought to offerUse OWC feeler

before you write an offer, learn the seller’s needs

and selling motives:

2.
3.
4.

Do they want or need a quick sale?
Do they seriously need cash?
Would a safe 6 to 8 percent return seem attractive to them?
If the property is currently owned by investors, what kind of
capital gains tax liability will these sellers incur from an allcash sale? Would an IRS-approved installment sale save the
sellers taxes?
5. What do the sellers plan to do with the proceeds of sale?
6. What other pressures of time, money, family, or work bear on
the sale?
These questions merely suggest lines of inquiry. Basically, you should
tactfully learn as much about the sellers as you can. Then draft your written offer to play into their most pressing needs.
Explain point-by-point how your offer alleviates their principal
concerns without giving rise to new ones. Are you a credible buyer?
Does the proposal create too much risk? A skilled Realtor may be able to
help you achieve this result. Remember, a confused mind always says no.

What Type of Seller Financing?
Although we often speak of “seller ﬁnancing,” the term really doesn’t
refer to just a single technique. In fact, as you gain experience, you’ll ﬁnd
that the wide ﬂexibility of seller-ﬁnance techniques gives OWC considerable advantage over bank ﬁnancing. Here are several of the most popular ways that sellers can cooperate and participate in the ﬁnancing
arrangement:
◆ Mortgage or trust deed
◆ Contract-for-deed
◆ Lease option
◆ Master lease

◆ Lease purchase
◆ Mortgage assumption
◆ “Subject to” purchase
◆ Wraparound

Mortgage (Trust Deed)
Generally speaking, when you ﬁnance your property with a bank, the
bank will loan you money (which is immediately turned over to the sellers), and you will sign a mortgage (or depending on the state where you
are buying property, the lender may use a deed of trust). By signing this
document, you pledge the property as security for your loan. If you fail
to make your payments, the lender can follow a legal procedure to auction off the property at a public foreclosure (trustee) sale.

Seller Mortgages (Trust Deeds)
Essentially, seller mortgages work the same as bank mortgages—except
that no money (aside from your down payment, if any) changes hands.
Instead, the sellers deed you their property in exchange for your pledge
to pay the sellers over time through periodic installments (usually
monthly payments).
But like a bank, if you don’t pay as agreed, the sellers can ﬁle a foreclosure lawsuit against you. If the sellers prove that you’ve failed to pay
(and you offer no persuasive legal defenses), your property will be sold
to the highest bidder at a public auction. You (and quite likely the sellers) will lose money. As a rule, foreclosure sales seldom bring in enough
money to make everyone whole.

71

Because OWC sellers can lose money if you
don’t pay, most property owners initially prefer to
cash out at the time of sale.They simply don’t want to
take the risk that you will default. Therefore, especially in low-down (or nothing-down) deals, you must
persuade the sellers using two separate reasons:

Emphasize Your Credibility and Reliability
Even though few sellers will put your credit and ﬁnances under a magnifying glass (as will a bank), they still want you to assure them that they
can count on you to make your payments on time, every time. You must
persuade sellers of your credibility and reliability.
To achieve this goal, marshal as much convincing evidence as you
can. Emphasize your consistency, character, and when favorable, your
credit scores (see Chapter 3). In addition, if you’ve built up a signiﬁcant
net worth, accumulated cash reserves, or maybe you earn a good income
from a secure job, play up any or all of these positives.
Stress Seller Beneﬁts To make OWC ﬁnancing attractive to the sellers, also stress the beneﬁts that the sellers will receive. I have found
many sellers who fear to carry back OWC ﬁnancing because they don’t
want the worries. But after I persuade them of my credibility and the
advantages they can reap, more often than not, they accept my offer.
What do the sellers get out of the deal? As noted earlier, I have
found that sellers are willing to carry back ﬁnancing for some combination of these six reasons:
1. No bank ﬁnancing available. A property may not qualify
for bank ﬁnancing. The property might suffer from poor condition; be located in a less-desirable neighborhood; or stand
functionally out-of-date (rooming house, apartment units with
shared bathrooms, irregular ﬂoor plan). Also, many lending institutions won’t write mortgages on condominiums or townhouses where more than 30 or 40 percent of the units in the
complex are occupied by renters instead of owners.
2. Quick sale. One of the best ways for an owner to sell a property quickly is to accept easy terms of ﬁnancing. Do the sellers
want to move on with their lives? Then follow the adage, “a
buyer at hand is worth two ‘maybes’ six months into the future.” Emphasize the here and now.

72

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

3. Higher price. Property owners who accept easy ﬁnancing
can often sell at a higher price than they otherwise could expect to receive.
4. High interest on savings. Sellers who plan to deposit the
cash they receive from a sale in certiﬁcates of deposit or
money market accounts can get a higher return on their
money by ﬁnancing a buyer’s purchase of their property. A 6
to 8 percent return from a real estate installment sale certainly
beats a 2 to 5 percent return from a certiﬁcate of deposit.
5. Low closing costs. With OWC ﬁnancing, sellers (and buyers)
pay far less in closing costs. You avoid much of the expense
that a mortgage lender would charge.
6. Tax savings. When the seller is an investor, an installment
sale of a property produces a smaller income tax bite than
does a cash sale. Installment sales permit sellers to spread
their taxes on depreciation recapture and capital gains over
the entire term of the mortgage.
As we look to the future, I expect the aging of the U.S. population
will bring about more seller-ﬁnanced transactions. Why? Because savings
accounts offer too little interest. Stocks offer too much perceived risk.
As a result, increasing numbers of seniors will prefer the larger returns
and small risks of seller ﬁnancing.

Who Handles the Legal Work?
In a few states, chieﬂy in the northeast, lawyers get themselves involved
in most property purchases—with or without seller ﬁnancing. In the
great majority of states, most sellers and buyers set
up an escrow account with a title insurance comTypically, a title

worth. And I know many real estate investors who feel the same way.
Still, when necessary, we do use them.1

Try a Contract-for-Deed
Among the most famous lines in American silent ﬁlm history (in The Perils of Pauline) is Oil Can Harry’s repeated warnings to Pauline,“If you
don’t give me the deed to your ranch, I’m going to tie you to the railroad
tracks.” Oil Can Harry knew that if Pauline signed over the deed to her
ranch, that deed would transfer the property’s title
to Harry. Although Oil Can Harry’s no-money-down

at the time of purchase. With the deed comes ownership (albeit often subject to a mortgage).
In some purchases, though, buyers don’t receive a deed at the time of
sale. Instead, they buy a property on the installment plan. In this type of
purchase, buyers usually pay the sellers a small down payment and promise to continue paying monthly installments. In return, the sellers give the
buyers possession. But unlike with a mortgage, the sellers don’t deliver the
deed at “closing.” Rather, they contractually promise to deliver a deed to
the buyers only after they have completed their scheduled payments.
This type of OWC agreement is known by various names such as
contract-for-deed, installment sale, or land contract. For beginning investors, a land contract can be an excellent way to buy property. I know
from experience.

Why Sellers Are Willing

no full-time job, and no signiﬁcant credit record. My immediate chances
for getting a bank to write a mortgage for me were zero. But this fact
didn’t deter me. I searched for owners who would sell their properties
to me on an installment contract. By the time I completed my Ph.D., I
had bought around 30 houses and small apartment units. The cash ﬂow
from these properties paid many of my college expenses (and yes, for my
Cessna and Jaguar XK-E2).
My sellers accepted this type of OWC ﬁnancing for most (or all) of
the reasons I listed. But the contract-for-deed then offered sellers one
more important advantage. If I failed to make my monthly payments, the
sellers could repossess the ﬁnanced property—almost as easily as a bank
can repossess a car.
Today, though, many states have made it tougher for sellers to repossess properties. Now, courts sometimes force contract-for-deed sellers to ﬁle a foreclosure lawsuit. Buyers gain more protection, but fewer
sellers are willing to put up with this extra hassle. So (in the tough
states), the land contract has lost much of its popularity to the lease option (discussed later).

Follow These Guidelines
When you and the property you buy meet the qualifying standards of a
lending institution, great. You can weigh the relative costs and beneﬁts
of each type of ﬁnancing. On the other hand, if bank ﬁnancing is not
available, always try to negotiate a contract-for-deed (or seller-held mortgage). Buying from a seller on the installment plan beats not investing at
all. If you’re a cash-short buyer, you can win with this strategy in the following way: Buy a rundown property with an installment contract. Then
create value through improvements. Next, reﬁnance based on the now
higher value of the property and pay off the sellers and put title in your
own name.
If you do ﬁnance a property with a contract-for-deed (or other type
of OWC), follow these guidelines:
1. Buy the property, not the ﬁnancing. Don’t let easy credit
draw you into the purchase of an overpriced property. When

circumstances warrant, you might in good judgment pay a
price slightly higher than market value. But you would not
pay $8,000 for any old car from Easy Ed’s “buy here, pay here”
used car lot just because Easy Ed will sell it to you with nothing down and low monthly payments. This same principle applies to investment properties. Beware of the real estate
gurus who urge you to entice the seller with the proposition,
“You name the price; I’ll name the terms.” Verify value
through an appraisal or other professional opinion. Don’t
agree to overpay.
2. Beware of hidden defects. A property that seems priced
right might suffer hidden defects. Take care to obtain experienced and knowledgeable estimates for any repairs or renovations that you plan. Never “ballpark” or casually ﬁgure the
costs necessary to bring a property up to the condition you
want it. Get professional property inspections and cost estimates before you invest.
3. Contract terms are governed by law. A contract-for-deed
places you and the seller in a relationship that is governed not
only by the contract language, but also by state laws and court
decisions. Under an installment sale, your rights and responsibilities differ from those you acquire when you ﬁnance a
property with a mortgage or trust deed.

Get a lawyer who understands both rewards and risks. Then negotiate a contract-for-deed that can work for you and the sellers. Over the
years, millions of Americans (especially low-to-moderate-income Americans) have successfully bought houses and small rental properties on
the land contract installment plan. I was one of them.

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

Assume a Low-Interest-Rate Mortgage
Although technically not a form of seller ﬁnancing per se, some sellers
do offer you the opportunity to take over their current mortgage. This
process is called “assuming the sellers’ ﬁnancing.” Seller assumables may
offer distinct advantages over new ﬁnancing:
◆ Lower interest rate
◆ Easier qualifying
◆ Low closing costs
◆ Little or nothing down

Return to the Past with an Assumable Loan
When market interest rates climb back up, you don’t have to pay those
higher rates. Instead, shop for a property with a low-interest-rate assumable loan. Say it’s three years into the future and you want to buy a
property. But market interest rates are again hovering around 9 percent. You fondly recall those bygone days when 30-year ﬁxed rate
loans set below 6 percent. If you could only climb into a time machine.
You can. Here’s how.
When you assume a mortgage, you roll back the clock and take
over the mortgage of the seller at the same rate the seller is paying—
even if that rate sits well below current market rates. Years ago, nearly all
sellers could transfer their low-rate mortgages to their buyers. By the
early 1980s, however, most lenders had changed their mortgage contracts to include the “due on sale” clause (the notorious paragraph 17).
This clause prohibits routine assumptions and upon sale (or long-term
lease) requires sellers to pay off their mortgage balance.
As a result, too many people today erroneously believe that all assumption possibilities have died. To further the problem, loan reps seldom tell borrowers about assumptions because
assumptions originate directly between sellers and

of dollars.” No, before you can assume a real estate
loan, you must locate a seller who has one.

77

Which Sellers Can Offer Assumable Financing?
Generally, sellers who have ﬁnanced their properties with FHA, VA, or
most types of adjustable-rate mortgages can offer an assumption to their
buyers. Realtor Roger Rodell describes his experience with assumables
during a past period of high mortgage rates.
Roger Rodell’s Experience with Assumables Roger has said,“I’m
promoting low-interest assumable FHA/VA mortgages. True, buyers do
have to qualify to assume these loans. And some of the lenders I deal
with aren’t too eager to push through loan assumptions for a few hundred dollars in transfer fees (compared to the several thousand dollars
they earn for new loan originations). But the lower rates and monthly
payments make qualifying easier and the cash savings for buyers are tremendous. If a fairly priced

sitting in front of you, don’t get greedy and demand
an even better deal.”
Cut Your Interest Costs by Thousands “I’ve worked out the numbers,” Roger continues. “Over a period of 5 years on a $100,000 loan, as
compared to a 9 percent new mortgage, a 7 percent assumable will save
you $8,400 in interest. Over 10 years, the savings are nearly $17,000; and
over 25 years, you’ll keep an extra $42,000. And those numbers don’t include the $2,000 to $4,000 that an assumable might save you in points,
origination fees, appraisal, and closing costs. Now, you can see why I
refer to a good low-interest assumable as a pile of $1,000 bills.”

Short-Term Strategies
Under some situations, you might even gain by assuming a mortgage that
carries a higher-than-market interest rate. Say current rates are at 6.5 percent and you’re negotiating with a seller whose assumable mortgage has
a rate of 7.5 percent. Not worth assuming? Don’t jump to that conclusion. Assumptions usually cost less in terms of time, effort, and cash-toclose than new mortgage originations. So, this 7.5 percent loan
assumption could prove proﬁtable if, say,

78

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

1. You plan to own the property for only a year or two.
2. Inﬂation has dropped to almost zero, and interest rates are
sure to fall further. You want to time your new mortgage to
coincide with the lower rates that you foresee.
3. You plan to improve the property to increase its value. Then,
you’d like to get a new loan based on the higher property
value that you have created.
4. Your borrower proﬁle displays some warts. New ﬁnancing at
the lowest rates available could prove iffy. In contrast, qualifying for the assumption probably will not require the same exacting standards. One year or two years of perfect payments
could set you up to then qualify for a new loan as an “A” borrower.
How to Find Assumables Right now, millions of outstanding FHA
and VA loans (ﬁxed-rate and adjustable) permit assumptions. Plus, most

Search for Sellers with Low-Equity Assumables
You’ve already seen that in periods of higher interest rates, you can slash
your interest costs by assuming a mortgage that carries a below currentmarket interest rate. In addition, assumables can help you buy with little
or nothing down. Just locate a seller who has bought (or reﬁnanced) recently with a low-down, high-LTV assumable mortgage. Within the past
three or four years, FHA and VA have originated millions of low- and
nothing-down home ﬁnance plans.
Due to the fact that the original loan balances
often add in closing costs and fees, most of these
buyers (now sellers) have built up little equity in

might ask for a seller second or arrange a second
mortgage through a mortgage lender.

“Assume” a Nonassumable Mortgage
Nearly all non-FHA/VA long-term ﬁxed-rate mortgages include the once
infamous paragraph 17 (the “due on sale” clause). This clause reads (in
part) as follows:
¶ 17. If all or any part of the [mortgaged] property or an interest therein is sold or transferred by the Borrower without
Lender’s prior written consent . . . Lender may, at Lender’s
option, declare all the sums secured by this Mortgage to be
immediately due and payable.3
Very few people understand the precise wording of this clause, but that
wording carries signiﬁcant implications.

3. This clause now often shows up as paragraph 18. It might carry another number in some other
mortgage contracts.

80

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

What This Clause Does and Does Not Say
Notice that nothing in this paragraph prevents owners from selling you
their property without ﬁrst paying off their mortgage. This clause only
gives lenders the right to call the mortgage due and payable if such a
transfer occurs without “Lender’s prior written consent.”

You Can Assume a “Nonassumable” Mortgage
Nothing prevents you and a seller from asking a lender to give its written
consent. Why would the lender agree to accept your request? Here are
several reasons:
1. The sellers have fallen behind in their payments and you agree
to bring the mortgage current.
2. The interest rate on the mortgage equals or exceeds the current market rate. Lenders hate “portfolio runoff” of their market or above-market rate loans.
3. You, the sellers, or both parties give the lender substantial
amounts of other business (loans, CDs, savings and checking
accounts).
4. You (or the sellers) promise to move much of your banking
business to the lender.
Will these or any other reasons you can think of persuade the
lender to grant its consent? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. But it doesn’t
cost to ask. When the situation warrants, lenders do oblige.
Unfortunately, most people ask the wrong question and get the
wrong answer. When looking at a property, they query the seller or
agent, “Is the ﬁnancing assumable?” If the mortgage includes a due-onsale clause, the sellers or real estate agent will routinely answer,“No, the
mortgage is not assumable.” Wrong answer. The correct answer is,“Yes,
it’s assumable with the lender’s consent. If you would like to try to assume it, we can make the lender an offer.”

the lender that the property has a new owner. The
buyer then continues to make the payments to the
lender on the same terms and interest rate that applied to the sellers.
Contrary to what some people say, this “subject to” technique is neither
illegal, immoral, or fattening. It does not even violate the mortgage contract.

Sellers willing, you

How I Have Used a “Subject To” I have used “subject to” ﬁnancing
with a number of property purchases. In 1981, for example, market
mortgage rates were at 16 percent. I bought a property “subject to” that
carried a mortgage rate of 10 percent. Because this property was a “ﬂipper,” I only owned it 18 months. But even during that short period, the
“subject to” mortgage arrangement saved me $17,000 in interest, points,
and closing costs.
Beginners Beware Several current authors and real estate get-richquick gurus are now peddling the “subject to” technique to the uninformed and inexperienced. Only instead of advising it for saving money
on interest, they’re pushing it to the credit-impaired as a means to buy a
property without lying prostrate before a lender. Here’s my advice: Beginners beware! Although this technique can prove appealing in some
situations—short-term holding periods, high interest mortgage environment, credit impaired—don’t
blindly fall for the sweet talk of the gurus. “Subject

lender calls the loan due, someone must either pay
up or reﬁnance the property.
Will Lenders Really Call the Loan? Some real estate gurus say,
“Don’t worry. Here’s a bag of tricks. Use these tricks and the lender
won’t ﬁnd out about the property transfer. Surely what the lender can’t
see won’t hurt you. No problem. Just keep the lender in the dark.”

82

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

Do these tricks work? Maybe, maybe not. After suffering through
the tumultuous 1980s and early 1990s, lenders have become far more
savvy. Some time within a year or two after a sale, the lender will probably learn that the previous owner (and original borrower) has sold you
the mortgaged property.
“No worry,” the gurus say. “Even if the lender discovers the transfer,
chances are the lender won’t call the loan due. Most lenders follow a
‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy. But they’re not going to advertise their forbearance. As long as your mortgage payments keep ﬂowing in on time
and the property taxes and insurance get paid, your risks are small.”
On this point (for now at least) the gurus may be right. That’s because today interest rates on most “subject to” mortgages equal or exceed current market rates. When rates spike up, though, I suspect that
lenders will send out the enforcers. Stay prepared.
Use “subject to” ﬁnancing to solve a short-term need. But, over the
longer term, you’ll probably need to come up with another source of ﬁnancing.

Five More Techniques to
Finance Your Investments

You ﬁnd a property that you would like to buy, but the seller (or lender)
won’t let you use a mortgage assumption or “subject to” purchase. Instead, the seller proposes a wraparound mortgage. Especially in times
of high interest rates, a wraparound mortgage can provide a win-win solution for buyers and sellers.

Wraparounds Beneﬁt Buyers and Sellers
Wraparound ﬁnancing yields big savings for buyers at the same time that
it puts proﬁts into the pocket of the seller. Only the lender gets shortchanged. Here’s how a wraparound works to overcome higher market
interest rates:

You offer to buy the property for $200,000. If the seller agrees to ﬁnance $180,000 at 7.5 percent fully amortized over 20 years, your payment (P&I) equals $1,450 per month.1 The underlying $100,000
mortgage remains in place, and its monthly payments will be paid by the
seller. To complete the purchase, you sign a land contract, mortgage, or
trust deed with the seller.
Each month the seller collects $1,450 from you and pays the bank
a monthly mortgage payment of $716 for a net in the seller’s pocket of
$734 ($1,450 less $716). Because the seller has actually ﬁnanced only
$80,000 ($180,000 less the 100,000 still owed to the bank), he achieves
an attractive rate of return on his loan of 11.1 percent.

Yet, you, too, gain. Had you ﬁnanced $180,000 with a bank at the
market rate of 9 percent amortized over 20 years, your payment would
total $1,619 per month instead of the $1,450 that
you’ll pay to the seller. The actual spread between

85

minimized income), unstable income (commissions, tips), or lack of
cash, do you believe that you can’t currently qualify for a mortgage from
a lending institution? Then the lease option (a lease with an option to
purchase) might solve your dilemma. Properly structured, the lease option will permit you to acquire ownership rights in a property. At the
same time, it also gives you time to improve your ﬁnancial proﬁle (at
least from the perspective of a mortgage lender).

Here’s How It Works
As the name implies, the lease option combines two contracts into one: a
lease and an option to buy. Under the lease, you sign a rental agreement
that covers the usual rental terms and conditions (see Chapter 17) such as:
◆ Monthly rental rate
◆ Term of lease
◆ Responsibilities for repair, maintenance, and upkeep
◆ Sublet and assignment
◆ Pets, smoking, cleanliness
◆ Permissible property uses
◆ House rules (noise, parking, number of occupants)

The option part of the contract gives you the right to buy the
property at some future date. As a minimum, the option should include
(1) the amount of your option payment, (2) your purchase price for the
property, (3) the date on which the purchase option expires, (4) right of
assignment, and (5) the amount of the rent credits that will count toward the purchase price of the house.

Beneﬁts to Tenant-Buyers (an Eager Market)
In recent years, the beneﬁts of lease options to tenant-buyers have been
extolled by the respected, nationally syndicated real estate columnist
Robert Bruss as well as by most books written for ﬁrst-time homebuyers.
For example, in my book, Yes! You Can Own the Home You Want (New
York: John Wiley & Sons, 1995, p. 59), I tell hopeful homebuyers,
There’s simply no question that lease options can bring home
ownership closer to reality for many renters in at least six ways:

86

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

1. Easier qualifying. Qualifying for a lease option may be
no more difﬁcult than qualifying for a lease (sometimes
easier). Generally, your credit and employment record
need meet only minimum standards. Most property owners will not place your ﬁnancial life under a magnifying
glass as would a mortgage lender.
2. Low initial investment. Your initial investment to get
into a lease option agreement can be as little as one
month’s rent and a security deposit of a similar amount.
At the outside, move-in cash rarely exceeds $5,000 to
$10,000, although I did see a home lease optioned at a
price of $1.5 million which asked for $50,000 up front.
3. Forced savings. The lease option contract typically
forces you to save for the down payment required when
you exercise your option to buy. Often, lease options
charge above-market rental rates and then credit perhaps
50 percent of your rent toward the down payment. The
exact amount is negotiable. And once you have committed yourself to buying, you should ﬁnd it easier to cut
other spending and place more money toward your
“house account.”
4. Firm selling price. Your option should set a ﬁrm selling
price for the home, or it should include a formula (perhaps a slight inﬂation-adjustment factor) that can be used
to calculate a ﬁrm price. Shop carefully, negotiate wisely,
and when you exercise your option in one to three years
(or whenever), your home’s market value could exceed
its option price. If your home has appreciated (or you’ve
created value through improvements—see below), you
may be able to borrow nearly all the money you need to
close the sale.
5. 100 percent ﬁnancing possible. You also can reduce the
amount of cash investment you will need to close your
purchase in another way: Lease-option a property that you
can proﬁtably improve through repairs, renovation, or cosmetics. After increasing the home’s value, you may be able
to borrow nearly all the money you need to exercise your
option to buy the property.
For example, assume that your lease option purchase
price is $75,000. Say by the end of one year, your rent credits equal $2,500. You now owe the sellers $72,500.

Five More Techniques to Finance Your Investments

87

Through repairs, ﬁx-up work, and redecorating, you have
increased the property’s value by $10,000. Your home
should now be worth around $85,000. If you have paid
your bills on time during the previous year, you should be
able to locate a lender who will ﬁnance your purchase
with the full $72,500 you need to pay off the sellers. Or, as
another possibility, you could sell the property, pay the sellers $72,500 and use your remaining $12,500 in cash proceeds from the sale to buy another property.
6. Reestablish credit. A lease option also can help you buy
when you need time to build or reestablish a solid credit
record. Judy and Paul Davis wanted to buy a home before
prices or interest rates in their area rose above their reach.
But the Davises needed time to clear up credit problems
created by too much borrowing and Judy’s layoff. The
lease option proved to be the possibility that helped the
Davises achieve their goal of home ownership.
Experience shows that when prospective tenants and
homebuyers think through this list of beneﬁts, they become a
ready market for lease options.

Beneﬁts to Investors
Although the lease option might help you buy a property, it can also
prove to be a good way for you to rent out your investment property.
You can structure lease options in many ways. This type of agreement
can typically beneﬁt you as an investor in at least three ways: (1) lower
risk, (2) higher rents, and (3) guaranteed proﬁts.
Lower Risk As a rule, tenants who shop for a lease option will take
better care of your property than would average renters. Because your
lease-option tenants intend one day to own the house, they will treat it
more like homeowners than tenants. Also, they know that to qualify for
a mortgage they will need a near-perfect record of
rent payments. (If your tenant-buyers don’t know

security deposit, and, more than likely, an option fee

of $1,000 to $5,000 (possibly more). Taken together, all of these factors
spell lower risk for you the property investor.
Higher Rents Lease-option tenants will agree to pay higher than
market rents because they know you will apply a part of that monthly
rent to the home’s purchase price. The tenants view these “rent credits”—actually they should be called purchase price credits—as forced
savings that will contribute toward a lender’s required down payment.
From your immediate standpoint, the higher
rent payments increase your monthly cash ﬂow and

rental may turn a negative cash ﬂow into a positive.
Guaranteed Proﬁts Experienced investors know that (on average)
fewer than 50 percent of lease-option tenants take advantage of their
right to buy their leased home. Sometimes they change their mind.
Sometimes their ﬁnances fail to improve as much as they hoped. Sometimes their personal circumstances shift (separation, divorce, job relocation, additional children).

than you would have earned under a traditional
rental agreement.
Even if the tenants do buy, you still win, because in setting your option price, you built in a good proﬁt margin over the price you originally
paid for the property. The lease-option technique works especially well in
those transactions where you have bought at a bargain price. You net
more than you would have gained from a straight sale of the property because you didn’t have to pay high marketing costs or agent’s commissions.
For investors, the lease option makes for truly a win-win agreement. You win when your tenants buy, and you win when the tenants
don’t buy and forfeit their rights in the property.

How to Find Lease-Option Buyers and Sellers
To drive the best bargain on a lease option as a buyer/lessee, don’t limit
your search to sellers who advertise lease options. These sellers are trying to retail their properties. It will be tougher for you to ﬁnd a bargain
here. Instead, look for motivated for-sale-by-owner (FSBO) sellers in the
“Homes for Sale” classiﬁed ads. Or, you might also try property owners
who are running “House for Rent” ads. Often, the best lease-option sellers will not have considered the idea until you suggest it.
When you search for tenant-buyers, generally you will be able
to choose from three different classiﬁed newspaper ad categories:
(1) homes for sale, (2) homes for rent, and (3) the speciﬁc category “lease
option” that some newspapers include. Unfortunately, no one can say
which ad category will work best in your market. Experiment with each
of these choices. To learn which one is pulling the best responses, ask
your callers to tell you in which category they saw the ad. Don’t simply
assume that any single category listing will draw the largest number of
qualiﬁed callers.

A Creative Beginning with Lease Options (for Investors)
To start building wealth fast without investing much money up front, try
the lease-option approach of Suzanne Brangham. Although Suzanne
stumbled into her investment career quite fortuitously, you can follow
her path more purposely. From her book, Housewise (New York: HarperCollins, 1987, p. 39), here’s Suzanne’s story:
While searching for the ideal career, I was also looking for a
place to live. I located a lovely but dilapidated apartment
house. The building was making a painful transition from
rentals to condominiums. Units were for sale or rent. But sales
were practically nonexistent.
With my head held high, preliminary plans and a budget
tucked under my arm, I decided to make the manager an offer
he couldn’t refuse.
I told him that in lieu of paying the $800-a-month rent
that was being asked for a 2-bedroom, 2-bath unit, I would renovate the entire apartment. I would agree to spend $9,600 for

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

90

labor and materials, the equivalent of a full year of rent payments. Along with a 12-month lease, I also requested an option to buy the unit at its $45,000 asking price.
Three months later, Suzanne was on her way. She then bought her
renovated condo unit at her lease-option price of $40,000. Then, simultaneously, sold the unit to a buyer for $85,000. After accounting for renovation expenses, closing costs, and Realtor’s commission, she netted
$23,000. Suzanne no longer had a home, but she had found a career.
Twenty years, 23 homes, and 71 properties
later, Suzanne had become not just independently
wealthy, but a nationally recognized author, speaker,

hundreds of proﬁt-making ideas that can be applied
to buying and renovating ﬁxers.3

The Lease-Option Sandwich
The lease-option sandwich truly magniﬁes your proﬁt potential. Instead of
buying a property outright, you ﬁnd motivated sellers who are willing to
lease-option their property to you at both a bargain rental rate and a bargain
price.Typically,such sellers were not advertising their property as a lease option. They generally are trying to sell it. In fact, they may not even have
thought of the lease-option idea until you put a proposal in front of them.

Control without Cash
Ideally, through this lease option you gain control of the property for
two to ﬁve years. Your cash-out-of-pocket totals less than you probably
would have paid in closing costs had you immediately bought and ﬁnanced the property with a new mortgage.
3. See also my own book on this topic: Make Money with Fixer-Uppers and Renovations (New

property owners. You proﬁt from the markup in
price and option money.
Your rate of return skyrockets because you gain control of a property with almost no cash investment. The up-front money you’ve collected from your tenant-buyers more than covers the amount you paid
as option money to the property owners. Essentially, you’re buying
wholesale and selling retail—without actually having to pay for your inventory.

Does the Lease-Option Sandwich Really Work?
Theoretically, it can work. (Just make sure you protect yourself fully in
the lease-option contracts you sign.) Robert Allen and James Lumley, for
example, two well-known real estate investors and book authors, claim
to have used this technique successfully to generate big proﬁts with little or no cash.
Personally, I wouldn’t try it. For my taste, giving someone an option
to buy a property that I don’t yet own seems fraught with dangers. Nevertheless, in theory this technique can yield high returns. So, if you’re interested in biting into a lease-option sandwich, read Lumley’s 5 Magic
Paths to Making a Fortune in Real Estate (New York: John Wiley &
Sons, 2000). Also, Peter Conti and David Finkel advocate this technique
in their book Making Big Money Investing in Real Estate (Chicago:
Dearborn, 2002).

Lease-Purchase Agreements
As a practical matter,the lease-purchase agreement works about the same as
a lease option. However, instead of gaining the right to either accept or reject a property,the lease-purchaser commits to buying it. As an investor,you

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

92

can often persuade reluctant sellers to accept your lease-purchase offer,
even though they may shy away from a lease option. The lease-purchase
offer seems much more deﬁnite because you are saying that you will buy the
property—you would just like to defer closing until some future date (say,
six months to ﬁve years more or less) that works for you and the sellers.

“Seems” More Deﬁnite
I say “seems” more deﬁnite because there is a loophole. You can (and
should) write an escape clause into your purchase offer called “liquidated damages.”With a liquidated damages clause, the sellers could not
sue you to go through with your purchase (speciﬁc performance) if you
chose to back out. Nor could they sue you for money damages that they
may have suffered due to your failure to buy. Instead, the liquidated damage clause simply permits your sellers to pocket
your earnest money deposit.
Always use a

purchase offers.

Amount of the Earnest Money Deposit
The real ﬁrmness of either a lease-option or a lease-purchase contract
lies in the amount of the up-front money the seller receives—regardless
of whether it’s called an “option” fee or an “earnest money” deposit. If
you want to really show a seller that you intend to complete a leaseoption or a lease-purchase transaction, put a larger amount of cash on
the table. By the same token, if you truly do want to “keep your options
open,” negotiate the smallest “walkaway” fee that you can, even if it
means conceding elsewhere in the agreement.

Contingency Clauses
You also can escape from your obligation to buy a property through the use
of contingency clauses. If the contingency (property condition, ability to
obtain ﬁnancing, lawyer approval, sale of another property, etc.) isn’t met,

Five More Techniques to Finance Your Investments

93

you can walk away from a purchase and at the same time rightfully demand
the return of your earnest money or option fee. Contingencies, option fees,
and earnest money deposits are further discussed in Chapter 16.

Master-Lease an Apartment Building
To make money in real estate, you need to control a property. The most
common way to obtain this control is through ownership. Some investors, though, don’t buy their multiunit properties—at least not right
away. Instead, they master-lease them. As we just discussed, buyers and
sellers typically use a lease-option agreement to convey condominiums
and single-family homes. But to acquire (without purchase) apartment
buildings, you would use a master lease.

A Turnaround Property
Say you locate a 12-unit apartment building that is poorly managed and
needs upgrading. You might offer to buy the property. But you really
don’t have the ﬁnancial power to arrange new ﬁnancing, and the owner
doesn’t want to sell the property using a land contract or purchasemoney mortgage.
Currently, the property barely produces enough cash ﬂow to pay
expenses, property taxes, and mortgage payments.

the building and manage the property to increase its
net operating income (NOI).
Generally, a master lease gives you possession of the property for a period of 3 to 15 years and an option to buy at a prearranged price. During
the period of your lease, you would pocket the difference between what
you pay to operate the property, including lease payments to the owner,
and the amounts you collect from the individual tenants who live in each of
the apartments. This technique resembles the lease-option sandwich that

How to Achieve Your Turnaround
How can you achieve such a spectacular turnaround? (1) Upgrade the
property and implement a thorough maintenance program; (2) your
more attractive property and more attentive management will attract
and retain high-quality tenants; (3) meter the apartment units individually to reduce utilities; (4) raise rents to reﬂect the more appealing condition of the property and the more pleasant ambiance created by the
new higher-quality, neighbor-considerate, rule-abiding tenants; (5) shop
for lower-cost property and liability insurance coverage; and (6) reduce
turnover and encourage word-of-mouth tenant referrals to eliminate
most advertising expenses.
Not only did this turnaround increase the

Sell Your Lease-Option Rights
Instead of going through with your purchase of master-leased property,
you might sell your leasehold and option rights to another investor.
Given the much higher NOI that you’ve created, you can assign your
rights at a very good price markup. In effect, an investor would pay for
the right to earn $25,958 per year (plus future rent increases) for the remaining term of the master lease. He would also gain the right to buy
the property at a now bargain price.
As you can see from this example, a master lease with option to buy
can create signiﬁcant proﬁt opportunities for investor-entrepreneurs
who are willing to turn a poorly managed, run-down apartment building
into an attractive, effectively operated residence for high-quality tenants.

How to Come Up with the
Money to Close

You’ve now learned several dozen ways that you can acquire investment
properties with little- or nothing-down ﬁnancing. Yet, even 100 percent
loans typically require at least some cash to close.
Plus, you may ﬁnd a great mortgage assumption or “subject to” deal
where the seller needs (wants?) to cash out the substantial equity that
he has accumulated in his property. So, for most of your investments, you
will need to bring some cash to the closing table.
Here are 23 ways that you can use to come up with all or part of
this money.

Cash Out Some of Your Current Home’s Equity
A low-cost home
equity loan makes
an excellent
source of cash to
expand your real
estate wealth.
96

If you’ve owned a home for a number of years,
you’ve no doubt built up tens (perhaps hundreds)
of thousands of dollars in equity. Through either a
home equity loan or a cash-out reﬁnance, you can
raise money at quite favorable rates. In fact, I know
of some high-equity homeowners who are reﬁnancing their homes with larger mortgages and then
using the net proceeds for cash bids on ﬁx-up properties at discount prices.

How to Come Up with the Money to Close

97

If your home has proved to be a good investment, now’s the time to
leverage up. Put some of that equity into buying and renovating properties. You might even consider downsizing. Move (at least temporarily)
into a smaller abode. To raise even more cash and credit power for investing in real estate, you could—Heaven forbid—even go back to renting for a while.
Don’t tie up large chunks of capital in your house when you could
use that money to accelerate your wealth building.

Bring in Partners
Who do you know that would like to earn the proﬁts that real estate can
provide, but lacks the time or inclination to take an active role? Such investing partners can provide cash to the deal and
they also may enhance your credibility and borrowing power.

2. Credibility. Which of these approaches would most persuade you to invest in a property? Someone simply asks,
“Hey, how would you like to invest $20,000 in a real estate
deal I’m putting together?” Or she says,“Here’s a copy of my
business plan for a real estate investment that I’m acquiring.
As you can see from this market and ﬁnancial analysis, a
$20,000 investment will pay you back $30,000 within six
months.”
To write this plan, you would highlight the market and property data
that we discuss later. To further boost your credibility and forthrightness, you should also pinpoint risk factors and how you’re prepared to
deal with them. For example,
◆ What if interest rates go up?
◆ What if your repair and improvement costs exceed the estimate?
◆ What if the rent raises or value-enhancing improvements take

longer than planned?
◆ What if rental or sales prices begin to soften?

All smart investors realize that no one can

though, anticipate problems. Then take

plans and prepare alternative exit strategies.

Because even the most promising partnerships (that is, marriages) can break down
into contentiousness, choose your real estate partners carefully. Deal only with someone who’s reasonable, easy to get along
with, and lives by a personal code of integrity and fairness. If plans go awry as they
sometimes do, you want a partner who will

sit down and look at reasonable and fair ways to resolve the cause of the
detour and cooperatively steer the investment back on track.
You do not want a partner who insists that you sign a 10-page, ﬁneprint partnership agreement that has been drafted by his or her lawyer.
The more you let the lawyers intercede into your agreement, the more
likely you and your partner will come to discord. Of course, here I’m
talking about small deals—not multimillion-dollar agreements, when like
it or not, the lawyers will probably actively participate in the partnership
negotiations.
Most lawyers would like you to believe that a good partnership requires an “airtight” partnership agreement that nails down precisely
each partner’s rights and responsibilities. Wrong! A good partnership
requires good people as partners. If, for small deals,

Second Mortgages
Say that you’ve found a great property, a motivated seller, and a lowinterest-rate assumable (or “subject to”) mortgage. You face only one problem. The existing mortgage has a balance of $190,000, the owner wants a
price of $225,000. You can only come up with $20,000 in cash. How can
you cover the $15,000 gap? Use a second mortgage.

world of investment real estate (and increasingly,

Personal Savings
How much cash can you raise from your personal savings and investments? If your answer comes in at anything under ﬁve ﬁgures (not
counting decimals!), you need to work through some ﬁscal ﬁtness exercises. For a philosophy that leads to sensible spending and wealth building see The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley and William
Danko (Atlanta: Longstreet, 1996). Their PWAs (prodigious wealth accumulators) rarely conspicuously ﬂaunt their wealth. Virtually every ﬁnancial expert agrees that before you can invest proﬁtably, you must learn to
spend well below your means. Save, save, save.

Sell Unnecessary Assets
Other than your house, can you sell, trade, or downsize any assets? Do
you own cars, boats, jet skis, or expensive furniture? What about that nolonger-pursued stamp or coin collection? I recently talked with one of
my readers who wanted to invest in properties but said she lacked cash.

Easy Money—Hard Terms

only in the cause of thoroughness. In some limited
situations, you may want to turn to an easy-money
lender. Within the real estate industry, such lenders
actually work under the label of “private money” or
“hard money.” I call them easy-money lenders because they will loan you money to buy, improve, or
reﬁnance almost any type of property as long as you
can fog a mirror.

Predatory Lending
In fact, some easy-money lenders intentionally loan money to people
who stand very little chance of paying it back. Why? Because these
lenders want to foreclose the property. Such lenders proﬁt from this tactic for three reasons:
1. Low loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Easy-money lenders only
make loans where the property value greatly exceeds the
amount borrowed.
2. Immediate collection. Unlike reputable mortgage lenders,
these easy-money folks don’t know the concept of forbearance. Miss a payment and they will sic the lawyers on you as
soon as legally possible.
3. High late fees and penalties. Not only do these predatory
lenders go after the delinquent amount owed on the mortgage, they make sure that you pay dearly for your failure to
make your payments as scheduled.
Both the state and federal governments have initiated an enforcement campaign against illegal predatory lending practices. Two such
lenders (Citigroup and Household Lending) recently

pect to receive a huge (and perhaps illegal or unconscionable) proﬁt
from these hard-money loans.

Why Would You Want to Deal with This Type of “Easy Money” Lender?
Lenders who specialize in easy money with hard
terms appeal to three types of borrowers: (1) the

money so desperately that they’ll sign away their fuproﬁt opportunity.
ture for immediate relief from some ﬁnancial difﬁculty, and (3) optimistic real estate investors who
care nothing about the hard terms of the easy money because they imagine high proﬁts from their venture. Assuming that you’re not a type 1 or
2 borrower, I will focus on a type 3 situation.
The Optimistic Entrepreneur Say you ﬁnd a desperate (that is, motivated) property owner who is willing to sell you his $300,000 “as-is”
property for $220,000 if you can come up with the cash within 10 days.
You know that after putting in $25,000 for repairs and sweat equity, you
could sell the house for at least $335,000. You want to grab this deal before someone else beats you to it. But how can you raise $220,000 on
such short notice?
The answer: An easy-money-hard-terms lender.
Hard term-lenders
What will this loan cost you? Can’t say for sure because the private mortgage industry includes thouspecialize in fastsands of small players as well as some of the major

mortgage lenders like Citigroup (which runs its
hard-money operations through no-name subsidiaries). Each player sets its own costs, terms, and loan-to-value ratios.
The structure of the deals also varies over time. Sometimes too much
money is chasing too few borrowers. At other times, too many borrowers are chasing after too little money.
With all of these caveats in view,Table 7.1 shows how your deal in
this situation might look.

Are these numbers realistic? Yes. Do they reﬂect a norm? No. As I
said, easy-money lenders remain idiosyncratic. Each deal is negotiated according to the particulars of the loan, the property, the lender, and the borrower. No Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae dictates rules. Plus, this deal showed
a great buy on the property, which is possible but not typical.

Where to Find This Easy Money The classiﬁed

Use Credit Cards
Although it’s one of the more risky techniques of creative ﬁnancing, some
investors take advantage of every credit card offer they receive in the mail.
Then when they need quick cash to close a deal, they raise $5,000,
$10,000, or even $50,000 from cash advances. Investors have been known

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

106

Personal Loans
In the days before credit card cash advances (which today are the most
popular type of personal loan), personal loans were called signature
loans. As you build your wealth through growing real estate equity, you’ll
ﬁnd that many lenders will gladly grant you signature loans for $10,000,
$25,000, or even $100,000, if your credit record and net worth can support repayment. You can use the money from these signature loans to
buy even more real estate. (Signature loans typically charge much lower
fees and interest rates than do credit card cash advances.)
Although some mortgage lenders set rules against using personal
loans for property down payments, a seller who ﬁnances your purchase
will seldom investigate the source of your down-payment money.

Sweat Equity (Creating Value through Renovations)
To enhance value through improvements and renovations, buy a ﬁx-up
property with 100 percent ﬁnancing. Say you ﬁnd a property that should
sell (in tip-top condition) for around $300,000. Yet, because of its sorry
state of repair as well as an eager seller, you can buy this property for
$160,000 with short-term no-money-down owner ﬁnancing. You then
contribute your labor and buy $10,000 in materials with your credit card
(or signature loan).
Once you complete your work and bring the property up to its
$300,000 market value, you arrange a 70 percent
LTV mortgage with a lender. Then with the loan proceeds of $210,000, you pay off the seller and your

Eliminate Your Down Payment with Pledged Collateral
If you don’t have enough money for a big down payment and you can’t
(or don’t want to) buy mortgage insurance or obtain a second mortgage,

How to Come Up with the Money to Close

107

you’ve got another possibility. It’s called pledged collateral. “We don’t
care where the collateral comes from,” says Elmer Frank of First American Savings, “As long as we feel secure, we’ll consider the loan. We’ve
taken stocks, bonds, mortgages, retirement accounts, and once a Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing. We did, though, refuse to accept a racehorse.”

Pledged Retirement Accounts
In terms of popularity, Elmer Frank adds,“Retirement accounts have become one of the most frequent sources of pledged collateral for our ﬁrsttime home buyers. We don’t even require that the account belong to the
buyers. We’ll accept funds from any close family
member. On no-down-payment mortgages, we usuThe account you
ally like to see 30 percent, but for good customers,
we’ve gone as low as 20 percent.”
pledge need not be
“In other words,” Elmer continues, “we’ll give

homebuyers or investors a no-down-payment, 100
percent loan, if, say, those buyers (or close relatives)
move enough of their 401(k) funds to our bank to offset 20 or 30 percent of the home’s purchase price. Last week, we closed a loan for a
young couple in their 30s who bought a $165,000 property. Between
them, they earn $70,000 a year; but they had little savings because
they’ve been rapidly paying off their student loans. We ﬁnanced their full
purchase price without private mortgage insurance and the wife’s
mother deposited $45,000 of her 401(k) monies with us.”

Other Types of Pledged Collateral
Retirement funds aren’t the only source of pledged collateral you can
use to offset your lack of a down payment. As Elmer Frank points out, his
bank (like some other lenders) will accept nearly any type of asset (savings account, stocks, bonds, perhaps even a valuable antique automobile). If you or your parents have built up a large equity in their home,
many lenders will accept that equity as pledged collateral.
If your parents (or other close relatives) would reﬁnance their
home (or other real estate), you might be able to use a blanket mortgage
to buy a home with no down payment. Say your parents owe $130,000
on their home now valued at $510,000. You want to buy a property

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

108

priced around $185,000. Many mortgage lenders would loan you and
your parents $315,000 so your parents could pay off their old mortgage
balance of $130,000 and you could buy the property you want at a price
of $185,000 ($130,000 � $185,000 = $315,000).
The lender would then record a blanket mortgage for $215,000 to
cover both properties that together have a value of $695,000 ($510,000
� $185,000). You and your parents would share responsibility for making the monthly payments. You would have bought your property with
no cash down and without having to pay mortgage insurance.

Student Loans
As I have mentioned, I bought my ﬁrst investment properties while I was
still in college. While my friends were using their college loans to pay for
their rent, food, clothing, tuition, and books, I used my student loan
money to acquire real estate. While my friends were stacking up debt, I
was building wealth.
Do you have access to any easy money like student loans? If so,
there’s the cash you need to close your ﬁrst investment. Student loans
work great because not only do you get a low interest rate, often you
don’t have to start paying them back until after you’ve been out of
school for a year. Remember, too, I sought out seller ﬁnancing—and the
sellers (unlike banks) didn’t ask where I was getting my down payment.

Use More Creative Finance
In addition to the techniques just discussed, here are several other more
creative ways to fund your cash to close:
◆ Agree to swap services or products. Does the seller need

some service or expertise that you can render? Inventory your
skills (law, medicine, dentistry, writing, advertising, carpentry, accounting, landscaping, architectural, etc.). Include all talents and
expertise of your profession, trade, and avocation. How about
products? Say you own a radio station or newspaper. Trade off

How to Come Up with the Money to Close

109

advertising time or space for a down payment. Anything you can
produce, deliver, or sell wholesale (at cost) might work.
◆ Borrow (or reduce) the real estate commission. Although
most brokers and sales agents generally hate this technique, on
occasion buyers and sellers ask the agents involved in a transaction to defer payment until some later date. Also some agents actually prefer to have their commissions in the deal. In doing so,
they avoid income taxes on these fees, while at the same time
they build wealth through their interest earnings or by receiving
a “piece of the action” (future proﬁts from the later sale of the
property).
◆ Simultaneously sell off part of the property. Does the
property include an extra lot, a mobile home, timber, oil, gas, or
air or mineral rights? If so, ﬁnd a buyer who will pay you cash for
such rights. In turn, this money will help you close the deal.
◆ Prepaid rents and tenant security deposits. When you buy
an income property, you are entitled to the existing tenants’ security deposits and prepaid rents. Say you close on June 2. The
seller of a fourplex is holding $4,000 in damage deposits and
$3,800 in tenant rent money prepaid for the month of June. Together, the deposits and prepaid rents amount to $7,800. In most
transactions, you can use these monies (credits at closing) to reduce your cash-to-close.
◆ Create paper. You’ve asked the seller to accept owner ﬁnancing with 10 percent down. She balks. She believes the deal puts
her at risk. Alleviate her fears and bolster her security. Offer her
a lien against your car or a second (or third) mortgage on another property you own. Specify that when your principal paydown and the property’s appreciation lift your equity to 20
percent (LTV of 80 percent), she will remove the security lien
she holds against your other property.
◆ Lease-option sandwich. Don’t forget the lease-option sandwich (Chapter 6). If you can pull it off, your lease-option buyers
supply you with all (or nearly all) of the cash you will need to
take over control of the property from the sellers.

Here’s How to Qualify

Up to this point, you’ve learned several dozen ways to raise the money
you will need to invest in real estate. Some of these techniques require
you to pass under a lender’s microscope. Others do not.
In the main, I’ve written this chapter to help you anticipate and prepare for those instances when you must go through a mortgage lender’s
formal qualifying process.
This chapter will also help you deal successfully with potential investment partners, real estate agents, and OWC sellers. Even though
these folks won’t scrutinize your ﬁnances as closely as a mortgage
lender, they will still want to see evidence that they can count on you to
live up to your promises.

Be Wary of Prequalifying (and Preapproval)
Most supposed experts in mortgage ﬁnance give this advice:“Before you
even begin to shop for a property, meet with a lender to get prequaliﬁed
for a loan.1 With prequaliﬁcation you’ll learn exactly how much property
you can afford. You won’t waste time looking at properties outside your
price range.”
1. Some say “preapproved.” But that advice, too, fails to address the critical points raised here.

110

Here’s How to Qualify

111

Superﬁcially, this advice makes sense. Why try to order ﬁlet
mignon on a hamburger budget? Yet, at a deeper level, realize that this
advice to prequalify does not necessarily promote your needs. You may
be able to borrow far more than a prequaliﬁcation (or preapproval)
suggests.

Why Prequalifying Sometimes Underqualiﬁes
In theory, prequalifying (preapproval) for a loan seems to make sense. If
you look at properties you can’t afford (unless you’re just curious), you
waste your time and it may psych you up for a big letdown. But here’s
the rub: No 10-minute computer-qualifying exercise can measure you
for a loan program as a tailor might measure you for
a new suit.

should buy.” Plugging your current credit and ﬁnances into a prequaliﬁcation or preapproval computer program pushes aside the real questions you should be asking:
1. What are your goals to build wealth?
2. How do your budget constraints differ (positively or negatively) from those assumptions embedded in the prequaliﬁcation program?
3. Are your current spending, saving, and investing habits consistent with your life priorities?
4. How long do you plan to own the property?

credit scores?

You Can Make Your Qualifying Ratios Look Better
If you buy anything up to a four-unit property (condo, single-family
house, duplex, triplex, quad) and ﬁnance it through a mortgage lender,
you will probably need to pass through the lender’s qualifying standards.
A majority of lenders will assess your borrowing power through the use
of two qualifying ratios: (1) the housing cost (front) ratio, and (2) the
total debt (back) ratio. These ratios will apply regardless of whether you
apply for owner-occupied ﬁnancing or investor ﬁnancing.

ratios.

Calculating the Ratios
With the advent of automated underwriting (AU) by computer, many
loan reps and loan underwriters no longer calculate housing ratios directly. In fact, some newer reps wouldn’t know what to do with a loan
ratio even if you showed it to them. Nevertheless, qualifying ratios matter a great deal, only now the math is hidden in the automated underwriting program.
But make no mistake. If you understand and improve your qualifying
ratios, you will raise the odds for loan approval and increase the amount

To keep things simple, let’s say that your household income (including anticipated rent collections) equals $7,000 a month. To buy the
property you want, you need a loan of $235,000. You decide to go for a
30-year, ﬁxed-rate loan at 7 percent interest. This loan will cost you
$1,563 per month (235 � $6.65; see Table 8.1). Property taxes and
homeowners insurance on this property will total $400 per month. No
mortgage insurance applies, but you must pay the homeowners association $125 per month to maintain the community swimming pool, tennis
courts, and clubhouse. Here’s how to compute your housing cost ratio
for this example:
$1563 + 400 +125
$7000
$2088
=
$7000
= 0.298 or 29.8%

Housing cost ratio =

Because the lender your talking with has set a housing cost guideline ratio of 28 percent, your numbers look like they might work. So we
next turn to the total debt ratio.
Total Debt Ratio The total debt ratio begins with your housing costs
and then adds in monthly payments for all of your monthly payments
(other mortgages, credit cards, student loans, auto loans, etc.). At present, say your BMW hits you for a payment of $650 a month, the Taurus
another $280. Your credit card and department store account balances
total $8,000 and require a minimum payment of 5 percent of the outstanding balance per month ($400). Here are the ﬁgures:

to settle for a lesser amount? Not necessarily.
If your credit score (see Chapter 3) is high enough, your loan may
still get approved. If that doesn’t work, maybe you can increase your
qualifying income, reduce your monthly debt, or provide compensating
factors.

You Can Lift Your Qualifying Income
In the previous example, we assumed that your income totaled $7,000
per month. In the real world, ﬁguring your income presents a somewhat
greater challenge (and opportunity). For to calculate qualifying income—that speciﬁc income amount entered into the denominator of
your qualifying ratios—lenders evaluate a range of actual and potential
income from sources such as:
◆ Salary
◆ Hourly wages
◆ Overtime
◆ Bonuses
◆ Commissions
◆ Scheduled raises
◆ Alimony

◆ Social Security
◆ Unemployment insurance
◆ Self-employment
◆ Moonlighting/part-time job
◆ Tips
◆ Disability insurance
◆ Stock dividends

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

116

◆ Welfare/ADC
◆ Pension
◆ Tax-free income
◆ Child support

◆ Interest
◆ Consulting
◆ Rent collections
◆ Annuities

As you look through this list, you can see that for many borrowers,
no precise income ﬁgure can be calculated. Consider the entries for
overtime, bonuses, and commissions. Over a period of months or years,
these amounts could vary widely.
Or what about unemployment insurance payments? How could
someone who’s unemployed (or expects to become unemployed) ever
hope to get qualiﬁed for a mortgage? Why would income from this
source count? Well, I know a savvy loan rep who routinely gets unemployment insurance counted. His borrowers work during summer stock
theater for very good wages. Then during the off-season, they regularly
collect unemployment. So, their qualifying income includes both their
earnings from summer stock acting and their regular checks from the
government.
Regularity, Stability, Continuity Lenders will count any income that
you can show as stable, regular, and continuing. Usually, a two-year history
with a promising (realistic) future is enough to satisfy the lender. On the
other hand, what if during the past ﬁve years you’ve typically earned sales
commissions of $4,000 a month, but during the past eight months that income has jumped to $6,000 a month? Here, the loan rep or loan underwriter must make a judgment call—which you can inﬂuence. Show the
loan rep persuasive evidence why your more recent earnings should
weigh more heavily than those lower earnings of years past.
Or think about alimony and child support. You may hold a court
order that requires your ex-spouse to pay you $1,500 per month. But
your spouse displays a casual indifference to honoring this legal decree.

teacher, but for family reasons, took leave for the past two years. Once
the family gets resettled in your new community, however, you plan to
return to full-time teaching. Will the lender count your future earnings?
With a good argument and evidence of intent, you probably can get at
least part of this potential income included. In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both offer dispensation for “trailing spouses.”

To secure loan approval and to maximize borrowing
power, present your income history, current earnings, and future prospects as optimistically as possible. You must anticipate and effectively respond to
any negative signals that may cause the lender to
doubt the amount, stability, or continuing nature of
your income.

Put Positives in Writing Award-winning credit explanations can
only sway hearts and minds when you put them on paper. Lenders follow this rule: “If it’s not in writing, it doesn’t exist.” Mortgage underwriters need CYA paperwork piled higher and deeper, just in case a loan
auditor investigates the ﬁles.
Nearly all lenders today monitor loan quality and data integrity
through internal audits. Without the paperwork to justify their loans, the
lender could run into trouble with regulators, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
HUD, or bank insurers. So if you want a lender to view your past, present,
and future income more favorably than it otherwise would, write out and
deliver your evidence—before the lender formally reviews your application. (Even when an AU system approves your loan application, a human

Also, with good supporting evidence, an underwriter

What to Count, What to Leave Out
To calculate total debt ratio, lenders usually divide your monthly payments into two types: (1) installment debt, which includes loans you’re
paying off such as autos, boats, medical bills, and student loans, and
(2) revolving (or open) accounts which include Visa, Mastercard, Amex
Optima, Home Depot, Texaco, and any other credit line that remains
open until you or your friendly creditor closes it.
Not All Payments Count Most lenders ignore payments for installment debts that are scheduled to be paid off within 6 to 10 months from
the date of your mortgage application. But if the lease on your auto is set
to end within a few months, you’re out of luck. Those payments still
count against you. The lender assumes (unless convinced otherwise)
that you will continue to incur this expense when you lease a new car to
replace the old one.
You do, though, get a break for qualifying when lenders look at
your revolving debt. Even if you regularly pay hundreds of dollars more
per month than your minimum payment(s) due, most lenders will only
count your payment as 5 percent of your outstanding balances. Or if
your minimum payment is less than 5 percent, lenders will count that
lower amount instead.

120

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

Prepare Far Ahead of Time Get your debt situation shaped up as
soon as you can. Not only will this ﬁscal ﬁtness program lift your qualifying ratios, it may also boost your credit scores. Here are some tips:
1. Consolidate bills. One loan consolidation payment of $280 a
month will hurt you less than four separate bill payments of
$125 each. However, don’t close three accounts and run one
up close to its credit limit. Credit scoring doesn’t like “high”
balances relative to credit limits.
2. Pay down debt. If your installment debt has only 11 or 12
months to go, prepay two or three payments. That pushes
those debts off the table and out of sight—under the rules followed by most lenders.
3. Pay off debt. If you can swing it, get rid of as much debt as
you can.
4. Avoid new debt. No matter how much you are tempted, do
not take on no new debt prior to applying for a mortgage.
Even if you can easily afford it, you’re better off waiting until
after you’ve been through closing.
These tips especially apply if your ratios are pushing against the
lender’s guideline total debt limits, if your credit score falls below, say,
700, if you’re requesting a low-down-payment loan (a loan-to-value ratio
of greater than 80 percent), or if you’re trying to qualify for a non-owneroccupied investment property.
A pint-sized debt load will help offset any warts in your credit
proﬁle.

Use Compensating Factors to Justify Higher Qualifying Ratios
No two borrowers are exactly alike. That’s why many lenders will bend
their approval guidelines when you give them prudent reasons to do so.
Compensating Factors Make the Difference Gordon Steinback,
an executive who works for the Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation, says his ﬁrm “routinely approves borrowers who don’t meet
standard underwriting criteria.” Yet, as Steinback points out, “regrettably, too many borrowers never get beyond the application stage. This

only someone shows them how.”

every time.
Types of Compensating Factors What types of compensating factors might lenders consider? Virtually anything positive that reasonably
demonstrates you can make your monthly payments responsibly and
control your ﬁnances. Here are a dozen examples:
◆ You’ve been making rent payments that equal or exceed the

after-tax cost of your proposed mortgage payments.
◆ You have a good record of savings. You regularly spend less than

you earn and you use credit sparingly.
◆ You are situated on the fast track in your career or employment.

You have a good record of promotions and raises.
◆ For your age and occupation, you have a high net worth (cash

value life insurance, 401(k) retirement funds, stocks, bonds, savings account, other investment real estate).
◆ You have put aside more than adequate cash reserves to handle
unexpected ﬁnancial setbacks.
◆ You or your spouse will generate extra income through part-time
work, a second job, tips, bonuses, or overtime.
◆ You carry little or no monthly installment debt. This can work
well when your housing cost ratio exceeds its guideline, but
your total debt ratio falls within its preferred limits.
◆ You’ve been through a homebuying counseling program that
helps homebuyers develop a realistic budget. Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac lenders give special deals to ﬁrst-time buyers who
complete these programs. Many only last four hours, and they’re
well worth the time.
◆ You’re making a down payment of 20 percent or larger.
◆ Your employer provides excellent beneﬁts: auto, cash reimbursement for a home ofﬁce, a superior health and dental insurance plan, large contributions to your retirement account.

122

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

◆ You earn an above-average income. Budget-conscious people

whose earnings exceed $4,000 or $5,000 a month often enjoy
the ﬁnancial ﬂexibility to devote more money to real estate than
typical qualifying ratios indicate.
◆ Your nonhousing living expenses are lower than average. You
would explain that you can afford higher mortgage payments because: (1) the property is energy efﬁcient; (2) you can walk to
work or just drive a short commute; (3) you have no costly vices
(smoking, drinking); (4) you spend conservatively: you backpack
for vacations, drive an unassuming car, and buy clothes at the
outlet stores; (5) you’re handy with tools so you can perform
your own property maintenance; or (6) your food costs are low
because you grow your own garden and enjoy all the fresh and
home-canned vegetables you can eat.
Put Your Compensating Factors in Writing After you’ve developed a list of reasons why you can afford the mortgage you want, put
your reasons in writing. Get supporting letters from your employer, minister, former landlords, clients, customers, or anyone else who can vouch
for your good character, creditworthiness, job performance, earnings potential, or personal responsibility. Sometimes, too, it’s a good idea to
write out a household budget. Deliver all of your evidence to the loan
underwriter. With good explanations, you’ll break through qualifying
guidelines that would deter or delay other ill-prepared investors.

The Application Itself Contains Many Clues to Your Integrity
Most lenders will carefully review your loan application. They search for
numerical discrepancies, missing information, gaps in dates, inconsistencies, and anything that smells ﬁshy. “Hmm,” the lender muses, “You say
you’ve been out of college only three years. But you show no debts for
student loans on your application and you report cash savings of
$25,000. Would you mind telling me how you managed that feat?”
Experienced loan reps and underwriters have examined thousands of
loan apps. Their eyebrows rise easily. If your life story evokes an air of mystery, don’t leave the loan rep in the dark. Provide ﬁrm evidence that you’re
traveling the straight and narrow. Even innocent lapses or discrepancies in
your application can spell trouble—if not satisfactorily explained.

No Rigid Borrowing Limits Apply to Commercial Properties
As you’ve just learned, when you ﬁnance a 1–4 unit residential property
through a mortgage lender, the lender will run through your total ﬁnances to calculate whether your personal income is large enough to
cover all of your monthly expenses—including all
mortgage payments (existing and those for which
you are applying).

rent collections to cover all of its operating expenses and mortgage payments.

An Eight-Unit Money Maker
I recently discovered an eight-unit property that is up for sale. This apartment building generates $40,800 a year in rents. The seller is asking
$245,000.2 Operating expenses (maintenance, property taxes, insurance, management, yard care, etc.) for the property total about $18,000
per year. After allowing, say, $3,000 per year for vacancy and collection
losses, an investor would still net (before mortgage payments) $19,000 a
year.
Even if you paid this seller’s full asking price of $245,000 and ﬁnanced 100 percent (no down payment), your annual mortgage payments would total just $16,700 (based on 30 years at 7 percent). Your
property would throw off a positive cash ﬂow of $2,750 a year—net of
all expenses and debt repayment. Because this property would pay for itself, many lenders (or sellers) would not particularly care how much (or
how little) you earned from your job. As long as you show that you are a
credible and creditworthy buyer, the amount of your personal earnings
would not play a major role in the lending decision.

2. I realize these numbers look absurdly low to Californians and residents of other high-cost areas.
That’s why I encourage you to invest elsewhere if prices where you live stand way out of reach.

HOW TO RAISE THE MONEY

No Cash, No Credit, No Experience
When I began buying properties, I was a third-year college student. I possessed no wealth, no credit record, and my only earned income came
from a part-time job. Nevertheless, by the time I had completed graduate
school, the income from my rental properties exceeded my job income
many times over. In fact, I owed $600,000 in real estate-related debt and
earned less than $20,000 a year.3

Are Such Deals Possible?
Are deals like these still available? Absolutely. They’re not as easy to ﬁnd
today—especially in high-priced cities—but the basic principle holds.
When you become a commercial investor, your borrowing power will
greatly exceed your personal qualifying power. I know a 43-year-old investor who earns $51,350 a year ($4,280 a month) from her job, yet
each month she pays $26,430 in mortgage payments. This investor consistently ﬁnances properties solely on the rental revenues she collects.

“Low” Income, Inexperienced Developers
As another example of borrowing way outside the bounds of one’s income, consider this project.
I’m currently working with an inexperienced development team
(an architect, lawyer, and building contractor) that is building a $40 million mixed-use residential/retail/ofﬁce project. Other than sweat equity
for personal (professional) services and some upfront incidental expenses for planning the project, none of the team

Here’s How to Qualify

125

Although this team of developers earns a combined professional income of around $300,000 a year, in the eyes of the lender this earned income will play no signiﬁcant role in its lending decision. When viewed
against a $40 million loan, personal earnings of $300,000 a year don’t
count for much. The potential revenue from the property will determine
the lender’s decision to ﬁnance (or withdraw) from
the project.

erties that yield enough income to pay for themselves.

The Debt Coverage Ratio
Your lender will use a debt coverage ratio (DCR) to help ﬁgure out
whether a multiunit investment property will yield enough net operating income (NOI) to cover the debt service and still leave some margin
of safety.4 Lenders want to satisfy themselves that even if rent collections
fall or property expenses increase, you will still be able to make your
mortgage payments without dipping into your personal funds.
You can calculate the debt coverage ratio according to this formula:

Debt coverage income (DCR) =

Net operating income (NOI)
Annual debt service

An illustration: Let’s return to that eight-unit property. Plugging
in the relevant numbers, we calculate the debt coverage ratio as

DCR =

$19,000 (NOI)
$16,700 (mortgage payments)

DCR = 1.137, say 1.14

4. To investors, the term “debt service” means the same thing as mortgage payments.

Even though you’re a beginning investor, I
would encourage you to see what types of small income properties are available in your area.5 You will ﬁnd that these properties (typically 5 to 24 units) will usually give you more cash ﬂow and
higher debt coverage ratios than single-family rental houses. As a result,
you may be able to ﬁnance a larger loan on a more costly property. That
has certainly been my experience.

Why Properties Sell for Less (or More) than Their Market Value
To see why you can buy properties for less than they’re worth, you need
to dig deeply into the meaning of the term “market value.” Under market
value conditions, a property sale meets these ﬁve criteria:
1. Buyers and sellers are typically motivated. Neither is acting
under duress.
2. Buyers and sellers are well informed and knowledgeable
about the property and the market.

payment, bargain price, below-market interest rate).
5. No out-of-the-ordinary sales concessions are made by either
the seller or the buyer (for instance, sellers are not permitted
to stay in the house rent-free for three to six months until
their under-construction new house is completed).
As you think through this description of market value, you will realize that owners who are in a hurry to sell may have to accept a price
lower than market value. Likewise, an owner-seller (FSBO) who doesn’t
know how to market and promote a property will not likely receive top
dollar. Or, say, the sellers live out of town and don’t have accurate information about recent sales prices. Or maybe the sellers don’t realize that
their property (or the neighborhood) is ripe for proﬁtable improvement.
In general, we can place those owners who will sell at a bargain price
into eight categories.

Owners in Distress
Every day property owners hit hard times. They are laid off from their
jobs, ﬁle for divorce, suffer accidents or illness, experience setbacks in
their business, and run into a freight train of other
problems. Any or all of these calamities can create

that’s what they’re willing to do. For these people
are not just selling a property, they are buying relief.
Under these circumstances, as long as the sellers believe they have
gained more from the sale than they’ve lost, it’s a win-win agreement for
both parties. If you are willing to help people cope with a predicament—as opposed to taking advantage of them—seek out distressed
owners. On occasion, they will give you the bargain price (or favorable
terms) you want.

The “Grass-Is-Greener” Sellers

been working 75-hour weeks for these past four
years.”
Will Karla Insist on Top Dollar? Think about it. In this situation,
does Karla think,“Well, the ﬁrst thing I must do is put my house up for
sale and go for top dollar”? Hardly. More than likely Karla will be willing
to strike a deal with the ﬁrst buyer who gives her any type of offer she
can live with. Karla’s got her eyes on the greener grass of Denver. Optimistic about her career and facing a time deadline, ﬁrst and foremost,
Karla simply wants to get her home sold as quickly as possible.
Grass-is-greener sellers stand in contrast to the ﬁnancially distressed. Whereas distressed owners sell on bargain terms or price to relieve themselves of pain, grass-is-greener sellers are willing to accept a
less than market-value offer so they can quickly grab better opportunities that lie elsewhere.
Even Pros Give Bargains Sometimes On one of several occasions
where I have been a grass-is-greener seller, not only did I give my buyers
a slight break on price but, more important from their perspective, I let
them assume my below-market-rate ﬁrst mortgage and carried back an
unsecured note for virtually all of their down payment. On at least a
dozen occasions, I’ve bought from sellers who were eager to pursue better opportunities elsewhere. Each time, I negotiated a good (if not great)
price and favorable ﬁnancing.
If looking for distressed owners doesn’t appeal to you, turn your
search in the opposite direction: Sellers who want to graze in greener
pastures (especially under a time deadline) are frequently the easiest
people to work with and the most accommodating in price and terms.

Stage-of-Life Sellers
When shopping for bargains, you also can ﬁnd good deals among stageof-life sellers. These sellers are typically people whose lifestyle now conﬂicts with their property. They may no longer enjoy keeping up a big
house or yard, collecting rent, or dealing with tenant complaints. They
may eagerly anticipate their move to that condo on
the fourteenth green at the Bayshore Country Club.

terms—stage-of-life sellers typically have accumulated large amounts of equity in their properties.
Plus, because they’re older, they have accumulated savings and don’t
need cash. Stage-of-life sellers can be ﬂexible. They don’t need to
squeeze every last penny out of their sale.
Good Prospects for OWC Given their ﬁnancial well-being, stage-oflife sellers make excellent candidates for some type of “owner will carry”
(OWC) ﬁnancing. Not only will OWC terms help them sell their property
more quickly, but an installment sale can also reduce or postpone the capital gain taxes that a cash sale might otherwise require. As another advantage, OWC ﬁnancing—even

fund (or perhaps even stocks).
My Early Strategy As a college student who wanted to invest in real
estate, I sought out stage-of-life owners of rental houses and small apartment buildings. These people were tired of managing their properties.
Yet, at the same time, they liked a monthly income and didn’t want to
settle for the meager interest paid by banks or take on the risks of
stocks. They also didn’t want to sell their properties outright for cash
and get hit with a heavy tax bill for capital gains.
Their solution: Sell on easy OWC terms to an ambitious young person who was willing to accept the work of rental properties in exchange

Twenty-Seven Ways to Find or Create Below-Market Deals

for an opportunity to start building wealth through investment real estate. This technique remains valid today. Because properly selected, wellmanaged rentals will pay for themselves, an investor who is willing to
work may be able to draw on ambition and perseverance instead of a
large down payment, a high credit score, and strong qualifying income.
Seller Ignorance Some sellers underprice their properties because
they don’t know the recent prices at which similar properties have been
selling. I confess that as a seller, I have made this mistake of selling too
low because I was ignorant of the market.
In one particular case, I was living in Palo Alto,
California. The rental house I decided to sell was loSellers who are

account for inﬂation and still leave room for negotiating.
The ﬁrst weekend the house went on the market, three offers came
in right at the asking price. Immediately, of course, I knew I had underpriced. What I didn’t know but soon learned was that during the year I’d
been away, home prices in that Dallas neighborhood had jumped 30 percent. After learning of my ignorance, I could have rejected all the offers
and raised my price. Or I could have put the buyers into a “bidding war.”
But I didn’t. I just decided to sell to the person with the cleanest offer
(no contingencies). I was making a good proﬁt; why get greedy?

Cranky Landlords
I love to buy from cranky landlords. These are the type of rental property
owners who still think they’re living in feudal times. These owners persistently battle their tenants. They complain, complain, complain. Eventually, they end up hating the

(Whoa, you say, “Is this what I’m getting myself into? Trouble,

Chapter 18, you will learn the 12 secrets of successful landlording—
actually I even detest the term landlord.That title no longer ﬁts the modern, enlightened owner of rental properties.)

Preserve the Lender’s Image and Balance Sheet
Banks, government agencies (FHA, VA), and the government-chartered
mortgage companies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac often become
“don’t wanters.” When their mortgage borrowers fail to pay back their
loans, these mortgage lenders often end up with foreclosures on their
books (called REOs, which stands for real estate owned).
Lenders Want to Mitigate Their Losses Once lenders take back a
property in foreclosure, they switch their thinking. They no longer focus
on making money. Instead, they want to get rid of these REOs on prices
or terms that will cut their losses. (Banks often name their REO departments “Loss Mitigation.”)
That’s where you come in. Because a pile of foreclosures hurts the
lender’s image with regulators and depresses its balance sheet with “reserves for bad debts,” lenders will frequently give investors good deals to
take these properties (or delinquent loans) off of their hands.
Multiple Investor Opportunities As you will see in Chapter 10,
when you learn how the total foreclosure process works in your state—
the foreclosure process is governed by state law—you can play and win
the foreclosure game with a variety of approaches. For beginning investors who are willing to put in the effort, lender foreclosures offer
great opportunities to snare below-market deals.

The Possibility-Impaired
Who are the possibility-impaired? This type of owner confuses his diamond in the rough with a lump of coal. These owners don’t see the potential that their property offers. Why? Several reasons explain this
inﬁrmity.

Twenty-Seven Ways to Find or Create Below-Market Deals

135

◆ The sellers are out of touch with what features buyers (renters)

want.
◆ The sellers lack the capacity to imagine and create.
◆ The sellers have lived with the property so long that they have

come to accept their property’s shortcomings.
◆ The sellers don’t know that the local zoning and building regula-

tions actually permit a higher and more proﬁtable use for the
property.
This short list does not even come close to exhausting the reasons
people miss the opportunities that lie before them. As the best-selling
author,Wayne Dyer, says,“You must believe it to see it.” Because the possibility-impaired don’t believe their property offers great potential, they
never even think to look.1

Don’t Dilly-Dally with Due Diligence
Although good deals go fast, don’t jump in before you’ve checked to see
whether there’s water in the pool. Always remember that not all bargainpriced properties represent good deals. You have scored a good deal
only if you can sell the property for substantially more than you have put
into it. Beware of underestimating ﬁx-up expenses. Beware of hidden defects. Beware of environmental problems (e.g., lead paint, underground
oil storage tanks, asbestos, contaminated well water). Beware of pouring
so much cash into improvements that you’ll have to overshoot the rent
level that tenants are willing and able to pay.
Always temper your eagerness to buy a bargain-priced property
with a thorough physical, ﬁnancial, market, and legal analysis. Especially
in cases of low- or nothing-down seller ﬁnancing, many beginning investors grab at a “great” deal without ﬁrst putting it under a magnifying
glass. Act quickly when you must. But the less you know about a property, the greater your risk.

1. For detailed ideas on how to create value with your properties, see Chapters 13 and 14 and my
book, Make Money with Fixer-Uppers, Renovations, and Rehabs (New York: John Wiley & Sons,
2003).

136

The Disclosure Revolution
Most states now require certain types of sellers to complete a disclosure
statement that lists and explains all known problems or defects that may
plague a property. But even if your state doesn’t yet mandate seller disclosure, you still should obtain a disclosure form (most major realty ﬁrms
keep blank copies on hand) and ask the owners to ﬁll it out. In reviewing a completed disclosure statement, however, keep in mind the following ﬁve trouble points:
1. Sellers are not required to disclose facts or conditions of
which they are unaware.
2. Disclosure reveals the past. It does not guarantee the future.
By completing the statement, sellers do not warrant the condition of the property.
3. Many disclosure questions require somewhat subjective answers. Are playing children a neighborhood “noise” problem?
Is a planned street widening an “adverse” condition?
4. Disclosure statements may not require sellers to disclose
property defects that are readily observable.
5. Pay close attention to any owner (or agent) statements that
begin,“I believe,”“I think,”“as far as we know,” and other similar hedges. Don’t accept these answers as conclusive. Follow up with further inquiry or inspection.
Insist on
disclosure facts—
not mere
opinions.

Seller disclosure statements help alert you to
potential problems. But even so, independently
check out the property to satisfy yourself that you
really know what you are buying.

Excluded Income Properties
Many seller disclosure laws apply only to 1–4 unit owner-occupied
properties. If you’re buying an investor-owned property or an REO,
the law may not require the seller to ﬁll out a disclosure statement. If
the seller does refuse, offset your additional risk by scaling down the
top price you’re willing to pay. Also, toughen up your prepurchase
inspections.

Additionally, when buying income properties,
verify rental income and operating expenses. Ask
the sellers to sign a statement whereby they swear
that the income and expense ﬁgures that they have
reported to you stand true. Beware of owners who
put friends, relatives, and employees into their buildings at inﬂated rent levels. These tenants don’t really
pay the rents stated (or if they do, they get kickbacks in cash or other beneﬁts), but their signed
leases sure look attractive to unsuspecting buyers.

How to Find Bargain Sellers

Here are ﬁve broadly deﬁned techniques:

Networking
Some time back I was leaving the country for several years and decided
to sell my house with a minimum of hassle. Coincidentally, the Ph.D. student club at the university where I was teaching was looking for a faculty member to host the upcoming faculty-student party. Aha, I thought,
what better way to expose my house to more than 100 people? So I volunteered. The week following the party, I received two offers and accepted one of them.
The buyers got a good price and excellent ﬁnancing. I avoided the
hassle of putting the property on the market and did not have to pay a
real estate commission. Everyone involved was satisﬁed.
This personal example shows the power of networking. What’s surprising, though, is that so few buyers and sellers consciously try to dis-

cover each other through informal contacts among
friends, family, relatives, coworkers, church groups,
clubs, business associates, customers, parent-teacher
groups, and other types of acquaintances. So don’t
keep your search a secret. Tell everyone you know.
Describe what you’re looking for. Why search alone
when you can enlist hundreds of others?

Newspapers and Other Publications
When most people look for real estate, they browse the real estate classiﬁeds with a highlighter, call owners or Realtors, get basic information,
and, when something sounds promising, set up an appointment. While
this method can work reasonably well, it also can fail for two reasons:
(1) if a property isn’t advertised, you won’t learn about it, and (2) if the
ad for a property you might be interested in is not written effectively,
you may pass it by without serious notice.
Try Running Your Own Ads To at least partially overcome these
drawbacks, run your own advertisement in the “wanted to buy” column.
When you describe the type of property and terms that you’re looking
for, you invite serious sellers to contact you. When I began buying real
estate, I used this technique to locate about 30 percent of the properties
I bought.
As another way to use the newspaper, read through the “houses for
rent,”“condos for rent,” and “apartments for rent” ads. Not only will this
research help you gauge rent levels, often you’ll see properties advertised as “lease-option” or “for rent or sale.”These kinds of ads generally indicate a ﬂexible seller.
Look Beyond the Classiﬁeds To search for potential bargain sellers in the newspaper, go beyond the classiﬁed real estate ads. Locate
names of potential sellers from public notices: births, divorces, deaths,
bankruptcies, foreclosures, or marriages. Each of these events can trigger the need to quickly sell real estate. If you contact these owners (or
their heirs) before they have listed with a sales agent, you stand a fair
chance of buying at a bargain price. (In addition, you might subscribe
to the “default” or “foreclosure” lists and newsletters published in your
area.)

Twenty-Seven Ways to Find or Create Below-Market Deals

139

Cold Calls Directly to Owners
To learn successful cold-calling, follow the techniques of Realtors. Most
successful real estate agents develop listing farms. A listing farm represents a neighborhood or other geographic area that an agent consistently cultivates to ﬁnd sellers who will list their properties for sale with
that agent. Agents who cold-call typically telephone property owners
with names gathered from a crisscross directory, walk the neighborhood, talk to residents, circulate ﬂyers by mail or doorknob hangers, and
take part in neighborhood or community-sponsored events. By cultivating a farm, an agent hopes to become well known in the area. An agent
positions himself or herself to be the ﬁrst person property owners think
of when they contemplate a sale.
Take a lesson out of the real estate agent’s playbook. Cultivate a
farm in the neighborhoods or communities where you would like to
buy. Circulate a ﬂyer, for example, that reads:
Before you list your home for sale, please call me. I am looking
to buy a property in this neighborhood directly from the owners. Let’s see if we can sit down together and work out an
agreement that will beneﬁt both of us.
Cultivate your
farm.

When property owners learn how they can
save time, effort, and money selling direct, they
may be willing to offer you a favorable price or
terms.

Vacant Houses and Out-of-the-Area Owners Your farm area will include some properties (vacant or tenant-occupied) that are owned by
people who do not live in the neighborhood. These owners may not see
your ﬂyers, nor will they be listed in a crisscross directory. To learn how
to reach these potential sellers, ask neighbors of nearby properties or
talk directly with the tenants who live in the property.
If this research doesn’t reveal the owners’
names and addresses, you can next contact the
county property tax assessor’s ofﬁce. There you can

awoken to that fact. With luck and perseverance, you could become
their alarm clock.
Expired (or About to Expire) Listings For any of a number of reasons, many properties listed with real estate agents do not sell during
their original listing period. When this situation occurs, the listing agent
will try to get the owners to relist with his or her ﬁrm. And quite likely,
agents from other brokerage ﬁrms also will approach the sellers. However, here’s what you can do to cut them off at the pass and perhaps
arrange a bargain purchase.
When you notice a listed property that looks like it might ﬁt your
requirements, do not call the agent. Do not call or
stop by to talk to the owners. Instead write the

while the property is listed, the owner is legally obligated to pay the sales commission.)
An example: Sellers have listed their property at its market value
of $200,000. The listing contract sets a 6 percent sales commission. The
sellers have told themselves that they will accept nothing less than
$192,500, which means that after selling expenses they would receive
around $180,000. You offer $175,000. Would the sellers accept your
offer? Or would they relist, postpone their move, and hold out for $5,000
to $10,000 more?
It would depend on the sellers’ ﬁnances, their reason for moving,
and any other pressures they may face. But you can see that even though
your offer is low relative to the market value of the property, your price
gives the sellers almost as much as they could expect if their agent found
them a buyer. (Naturally, your letter would not formally commit you to
the purchase. It would merely state the price or terms that you have in
mind.)

Real Estate Agents
Do not conclude from the above technique that you should never use a
real estate agent to help you ﬁnd bargain-priced investment properties.
A top agent can assist you in many ways. However, agents do deserve to

be paid for their services. So if you’re planning to
buy at a bargain price or buy on bargain terms (especially with low- or no-down-payment ﬁnancing),
where’s the agent’s fee going to come from? To pursue the best deal possible, at times you may have to
forgo an agent’s services and do your own legwork.

Cruise the Information Highway
Today’s investors not only cruise neighborhoods, they also cruise the Internet to look for properties. Thousands of websites now list properties
for sale. Property buyers (or browsers) can access the Realtor’s Multiple
Listing Service (MLS) through Realtor.com.
There is also a budding entrepreneurial industry that is accumulating specialized listings of everything from foreclosures to distressed
properties to FSBOs. Going online you can locate investors looking for money—or money looking for

Make Money with Foreclosures
and REOs
If you’ve watched some of the real estate infomercials, you might believe
that it’s easy to buy a property at a foreclosure auction for just pennies
on the dollar—then quickly resell that property for a large and easy
windfall gain. Not true.

The Stages of Foreclosure
In fact, buying foreclosures “on the courthouse steps”represents just one
type of foreclosure possibility. And that widely promoted approach entails big risks and uncertain proﬁts. Consequently, experienced and successful investors usually buy before or after a foreclosure auction—not
during. As a beginner, that, too, is where you should place your efforts.

Owner’s Default (the First Stage)
When property owners fail to pay their mortgage payments, at ﬁrst their
lender will encourage, coerce, or threaten them through “reminder” letters, telephone calls, or credit counseling. If those efforts don’t produce
results, the lender’s lawyers take over. Talking tough, the lawyers usually
threaten foreclosure and warn the property owners to either pay up or
face serious trouble.
143

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

Lenders favor loan
workouts over

Near-record

workouts.

Typically, lenders may continue their loan
workout efforts for anywhere from one to six
months, or maybe longer. In contrast to the late
1980s and early 1990s, most lenders today do tend
to give borrowers generous opportunity to reinstate
or even reﬁnance their delinquent mortgages.
As a result, fewer properties now end up at
foreclosure sales—especially compared with the
tidal wave of foreclosures that ﬂooded the market
10 to 15 years ago. Even so, lenders will get the keys
to more than 100,000 properties this year. And the
number of borrowers who fall behind in their payments (and are in need of a loan workout) exceeds 2
million people a year. So, even though pickings
aren’t as good as they once were, beginning investors can still locate great foreclosure buys.

Filing Legal Notice
When a lender does ﬁnally give up on a workout, its lawyers either ﬁle a
legal “notice of default” or a “lawsuit to foreclose” (depending on the
state). The lender then posts notice of this suit on the Internet and in
newspapers. These postings tell the property owners, any other parties
who may have legal claims against the owners or their property, and the
public in general that legal action is moving forward to force a sale of the
property.

The Foreclosure Sale (the Second Stage)
Eventually, when the defaulting borrowers run out of time, legal defenses, or delaying maneuvers, the foreclosure sale date arrives. At this
point, the court trustee auctions the property to the
highest cash bidder.
On occasion, a real estate investor (a forecloLenders often win

fees, accrued interest, attorney fees, foreclosure costs) and walks away
with a “sheriff’s” deed to the property. From then on until the lender
sells the property, that property remains on the lender’s books as real estate owned—an REO.

Lender’s Don’t Want REOs (the Third Stage)
The most important thing to know concerning foreclosure should be
written in capital letters: LENDERS DO NOT WANT TO OWN FORECLOSED REAL ESTATE. For lenders—including such institutions as the
Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac—holding onto an REO that they
have acquired through foreclosure rarely seems like a good idea. No matter how much potential the property offers, lenders who own REOs
want to sell quickly. For you, their desire to sell quickly may mean their
loss and your gain.

You can negotiate with the distressed property owners and, if
necessary, the foreclosing lender.
You can bid at the foreclosure auction.
You can negotiate and buy directly from the lender or its insuring agency (FHA, VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) that owns
the property as an REO.

Approach Owners with Empathy: Step One
There’s no magic system that you can use to buy a property from owners facing foreclosure. These owners are plagued with ﬁnancial troubles,
personal anguish, and indecisiveness. In addition, they probably have
been attacked by innumerable foreclosure sharks, speculators, bank
lawyers, and recent attendees of “get-rich-quick” foreclosure seminars.
These owners are living with public shame. For all of these reasons and
more, they are not easy people to deal with.

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

Yet when you develop a sensitive, empathetic, problem-solving
approach with people suffering foreclosure, you may be able to come
up with a win-win agreement. Just keep in mind that more than likely
you won’t be the only investor who pays them a visit. A “Here’s my
offer—take it or leave it” approach will undoubtedly antagonize owners. This approach will not favorably distinguish you from a dozen
other potential foreclosure buyers (sharks). So develop your offer and negotiations to preserve what

Meet the Property Owners
When you visit with the property owners, you will try to make a good
buy. But also, approach the troubled owners with aid that will end their
distress. When everything goes right, the owners will receive cash for
some of their equity, their credit will be salvaged, and you will acquire
title to the property.
Here are several approaches you can use to open negotiations with
an owner in foreclosure:

Don’t Fear Run-Down Properties
Do not be put off by cosmetic damage to the house as long as the house
is structurally sound. A run-down house usually gives you more chance
to proﬁt. In fact, the more cosmetically run-down, the better. Every easily
curable defect offers proﬁtable opportunity to the shrewd distressedproperty investor and renovator.
Thoroughly check out the entire property.
Carefully analyze it. Then accurately evaluate the

exceed your probable resale value, don’t necessarily
abandon the project. Go back to the troubled
owner (or mortgage lender) and reopen negotiations. Point out that you
must make a reasonable proﬁt. If still you’re unable to arrive at a good
deal, then look elsewhere.

Vacant Houses
To discover a vacant house in foreclosure means to discover both a problem and an opportunity. It’s a problem because you may have to do
some detective work to locate the owners. Unless the owners have purposely tried to disappear, though, you can probably locate them in one of
the following ﬁve ways:
1. Contact nearby neighbors to learn the owners’ whereabouts,
or the names of friends or family who would know.
2. Call the owners’ telephone number and see if you get a “number changed” message.
3. Ask the post ofﬁce to provide the owners’ forwarding address.
4. Find out where the owners were employed and ask coworkers.
5. Contact the school that the owners’ children attended and ask
where their school records were sent. (However, with today’s
concerns about privacy, I’ve found that many school personnel will no longer give out school transfer information.)

Sometimes Losing Less Is Winning
If the property goes to the foreclosure sale, more often than not, the
lender and the property owners will lose money. But think what happens when all parties agree to work with each other, rather than against
each other. You can create an outcome where everyone walks away better off. Maybe they receive less than they hoped for, certainly less than
they were theoretically entitled to, but far more than they could expect
from a bidder at a foreclosure auction.

Some Investors Do Proﬁt from the Foreclosure Auction: Step Two
Although foreclosure sales typically lose money for lenders, lienholders,
and property owners, savvy bidders can turn these sales into big proﬁts.
But it’s not easy. Bidding blind doesn’t work. You have to do your homework.

Why Foreclosures Sell for Less than Market Value
A typical foreclosed property does sell at a price less than its market
value. Why? Because foreclosure auctions don’t come close to meeting
the criteria of a market value transaction (see Box 10.1).

Characteristics of a Foreclosure Sale

As you can see, foreclosure auctions seem purposely designed to
yield the lowest possible sales price. They take place under conditions
that violate all principles of effective marketing.

Make the Puny Sales Efforts Work for You
For most would-be buyers, the potential risk, expense, and aggravation of
foreclosure sales deter them from even showing up to bid. When you
consider the lame marketing efforts, the adverse conditions of sale, and
the potential owner (tenant) eviction problem, is it any wonder that
foreclosed properties deserve to sell at a “fraction of their market value”?
Indeed, you might look at the foreclosure sales process and say,
“Too many potential problems. No way do I want to take those kinds of
risks. Besides, how could I ever come up with so
much cash on short notice?” Clearly, that’s the attitude of the great majority of real estate investors. It

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

Overcome the Risks of Bidding
RISK looms large to block your path to foreclosure sale proﬁts. So the
key to savvy bidding lies in knowing as much about the property as due
diligence demands.
How can you get this information? First, meet with the property
owners to talk over possibilities for working out a deal before foreclosure. Even when those discussions end without agreement, you’ve still
been able to learn about the property (market value, ﬁx-up needs, improvement opportunities), the neighborhood, and the owner’s intentions. This step alone puts you way ahead of the game.
Second, quickly research liens against the title to the property at
the courthouse—or online. You want to list every claim or judgment
that you will have to satisfy to clear title. If you decide to pursue the
property, you will need to verify the quality of the title with a lawyer or
title insurer. I have usually found the clerical workers at the courthouse helpful when I’m unfamiliar with the record-ﬁling procedures in
an area.

How to Arrange Financing
After you gather information to manage the risks of buying at foreclosure, you still face the problem of ﬁnancing. How are you going to get
the cash to close the sale? If you lack wealth or credit, you’re probably
out of luck. Unless you bring in a money partner you really can’t play the
foreclosure game.
However, if you can even temporarily raise cash—such as a home
equity loan, credit card cash advances, selling (or borrowing against)
stocks, or maybe a signature loan—you can bid at a foreclosure auction.
Then, after the foreclosure paperwork clears, you can place an interim or
longer-term mortgage loan against the property and pay off your shortterm creditors.
Established investors who routinely buy foreclosed properties generally establish a line of perRaise the cash to

The Foreclosure Sale: Summing Up
If you are willing to learn the foreclosure game (as it’s played in your
local area), do your homework on properties, and manage your risks, you
can build proﬁts quickly. You can buy properties at foreclosure auctions
“for a fraction of their market value.”Your challenge is to learn which of
these properties meet the test of a true bargain—and which ones to
avoid because they carry severe risks or expensive problems.

The Beneﬁts of Buying REOs: Step Three
You can say one thing for certain about an REO: That lender wants to sell
the property as quickly as possible. Mortgage lenders like to make loans
and collect monthly payments. They do not like to own and manage
properties. As a result, they often grant buyers of their REOs a bargain
price, favorable terms such as low or no closing costs, below-market interest rates, and low down payments, or even some combination of all of
these beneﬁts.
If the property needs ﬁx-up work that the lenders would prefer not
to remedy, they may accept offers at deep discounts from market value.
Just as important, prior to closing the sale of their REOs, lenders normally clean up title problems, evict unauthorized occupants, and bring
all past-due property tax payments and assessments up to date. Some
lenders, too, permit buyers to write offers subject to an appraisal or professional inspection (contingency clauses).

Safer than Buying at the Foreclosure Sale
Buying an REO directly from a lender typically presents no more risk
than buying directly from any other property owner.1 Normally, you can
1. Several exceptions might include: (1) states where the foreclosed owners may have a right of
redemption; (2) if the foreclosed owners still retain some legal right to challenge the validity of the
foreclosure sale; or (3) if a bankruptcy trustee or the Internal Revenue Service (tax lien) is entitled
to bring the property within their powers. Rarely would any of these potential claims be worth
losing sleep over. But prior to closing an REO purchase, you might want to run these issues by
legal counsel.

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

152

buy an REO much more safely than you could have bought the same
property at its foreclosure sale. Depending on the lender’s motivation,
its internal policies and procedures, and the property loan-to-value ratio
(LTV) at the time of the foreclosure sale, you might even be able to buy
at a price lower than market value.

Why a Lower Price?
Let’s say the market value of a property at the time of its foreclosure sale
was $165,000. The lender’s claims against the property totaled
$160,000. To win the property away from the lender, you would have
had to bid more than $160,000—a price that’s too high to yield a proﬁt.
However, once the lender owns the property
and tallies its expected holding costs, Realtor’s commission, and the risks of seeing the (probably) vaIt costs lenders big

losses. It may accept an offer from you within the

offer cash, which you may borrow from some other
mortgage lender).
In desperate times REO lenders may turn to mass marketing and
highly advertised public auctions to unload their REOs. In stable to
strong markets, they generally (but not always) play it low key. If it can
be avoided, no lender wants to publicize the fact that it’s “throwing
down-on-their-luck families out of their homes.” So, absent tough times
and mass advertising, you can ﬁnd REOs in three different ways:
◆ Follow up after a foreclosure sale.
◆ Cold-call lender REO personnel.
◆ Locate Realtors who typically get REO listings.

Follow Up After Foreclosure
You can easily learn of lender REOs by attending foreclosure auctions.
When a lender casts a top bid for a property in which you’re interested,
buttonhole the bidder and start talking business. Or try to schedule an
appointment to see the ofﬁcer who takes charge of the management and

rules that frequently work against sensible decisions. If you run into a bureaucratic stonewall, you
must persevere. The reward of following through doesn’t just lie in getting a good deal on a property now. More important, you will build personal relationships that will open the bank’s doors for you in future
transactions.
Open discussions

Cold-Call REO (Loss Mitigation) Personnel
All mortgage lenders experience at least a few borrower defaults. No
one has yet designed a foolproof system for predicting which loan applicants will fail to pay. It follows, then, that at one time or another all mortgage lenders must end up with REOs—even if eventually they pass them
along to HUD,VA, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac.
Sometimes, too, lenders pick up REOs without going through foreclosure. During the last real estate downturn, many lenders would open
their morning mail to ﬁnd the keys to a house, a deed, and a note from
the distressed owners saying,“We’re out of here. It’s your problem now.”
To ﬁnd REOs that lenders have acquired through foreclosure or
“deed-in-lieu” transfers, you can cold-call mortgage lenders. You might
ask for a list of their REOs. This technique, though, seldom turns up
much. For various reasons, lenders may keep a tight hold on this information. Nevertheless, it doesn’t cost to ask.
Until you establish relationships with REO personnel, you may ﬁnd the following approach works

closing the full number of REOs within its inventory.

154

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

Locate Specialty Realtors
Many mortgage lenders avoid selling directly to REO investors (though
they do make exceptions) for two reasons: (1) as mentioned, they don’t
like the unfavorable publicity, and (2) they want to promote good relations with Realtors.2 Because most mortgage lenders expect Realtors to
bring them new loan business, these same lenders can’t then turn
around and become FSBO (for sale by owner) dealers. “You scratch my
back and I’ll scratch yours” sets the rules in business.
As one part of your efforts to ﬁnd REOs, cultivate relationships with
Realtors who specialize in this market. (In fact, HUD,VA, Fannie Mae, and
Freddie Mac almost always sell their REOs through Realtors.) In most
cities, you can easily ﬁnd REO specialists by looking through newspaper
classiﬁed real estate ads.
Hire a Real Pro Once you have identiﬁed several foreclosure specialists, give each one a call. Learn their backgrounds. Do they only dabble
in the ﬁeld of REOs and foreclosures? Or do they make this ﬁeld their
full-time business? When I recently telephoned REO specialist John
Huguenard, for example, he talked with me for an
hour and a half about property availability, detailed

properties as well as selecting tenants, and a dozen
other related topics.
At one point during our conversation, he asked,“I’ll bet you haven’t
talked to any other agents who know as much as I do about REOs and
foreclosures, have you? I’ve been doing this 23 years. Last year, I sold 90
houses and rehabbed 16 others for my own account.” John was right. I
hadn’t.
Beware of False Experts John’s the kind of real estate professional
you want to ﬁnd. Although many realty agents claim expertise in REOs
and foreclosures—“Sure, I can do that for you”—only a few make it their
prime activity, day in and day out, year after year. When you work with an

agent who’s really in the know, you won’t have to do your own legwork
and door knocking. Your agent will screen properties as soon as—if not
before—they come onto the market. You will then be notiﬁed immediately.
Plus, specialty agents with in-depth knowledge also will stay on top
of the ﬁnance plans that portfolio, government, and conventional
lenders are offering to home buyers and investors. (Again, for example,
John Huguenard knew of portfolio lenders doing 100 percent LTV investor loans for investor acquisition and rehab.)
Avoid the foreclosure dabblers. Work with a real pro, someone who
knows all of the current rules, regulations, and operating procedures.
HUD, VA, Fannie, and Freddie Won’t Sell Direct to Buyers No
matter what approach to acquiring REOs and foreclosures you choose to
follow, you will beneﬁt by talking with realty pros who make the business a career. As noted earlier, though, if you buy an REO from HUD,VA,
Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, you must process your offer through a
lender-authorized real estate agent. Only in certain exceptional circumstances would any of these organizations negotiate with you directly.
Your REO specialist will know all of the ins and outs necessary to deal
with these agencies and ﬁrms.

More Sources of Bargains

You may think that we’ve exhausted the possibilities for ﬁnding bargain
deals. But no. You’ve got at least 11 more sources of bargains.

Federal Government Auctions
Each year agencies of the federal government (in addition to HUD and the
VA) sell all types of seized and surplus real estate including homes, apartment complexes, ofﬁce buildings, ranches, and vacant and developed land.
Among the most active sellers are the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
General Services Administration (GSA), and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC). On occasion, you can also ﬁnd properties offered by
the Small Business Administration (SBA). Although space here doesn’t permit full discussion of each of these agencies, you can locate their properties and sales procedures at the following websites:

157

Sheriff Sales
In addition to foreclosures, you might want to follow sheriff sales or other
legally mandated involuntary property sales. These sales may result from
property tax liens, civil lawsuit judgments, and bankruptcy creditors.
Because of the local nature of these types of forced sales, I can’t go
into the details that relate to speciﬁc sales procedures or the relative possibilities for ﬁnding bargain prices. I can only say,“It all depends.”Yet if your
goal is to leave no stone unturned in your attempt to locate good deals, talk
with real estate lawyers, courthouse ofﬁcials, foreclosure speculators, and
others who are in the know about these types of sales. Because these sales
take place under less than ideal marketing methods, it’s only natural to expect selling prices that fall substantially below a property’s market value.

Buy from Foreclosure Speculators
Another way to proﬁt from foreclosure and forced sale auctions without
actually bidding is to buy from a winning bidder shortly after the foreclosure sale.
Say a foreclosure speculator puts in a winning bid of $145,000 on a
property that seems to have a market value of $195,000 if it were ﬁxed
up and marketed effectively. After the auction, you offer the speculator
$170,000 (or whatever). To minimize risk, you attach several contingencies to your offer that permit you to get the property thoroughly inspected, evict any holdover owners or tenants, clear
up title problems, seek title insurance, and arrange

Probate and Estate Sales
Probate and estate sales present another potential source of bargain
properties. When owners of properties die, their property may be sold

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

158

to satisfy the deceased’s mortgagee and other creditors. Even when the
deceased leaves sufﬁcient wealth in cash to satisfy all claims against the
estate, heirs still normally prefer to sell the property rather than retain
ownership.

Probate
To buy a property through probate, generally you submit a bid through
the estate’s administrator (usually a lawyer) or executor. Then all bids are
reviewed by the probate judge assigned to the case. Depending on local
and state laws, the judge may then select a bid for approval or reopen the
bidding. Because of legal procedures and delays, bidding on probate
properties can require perseverance. Judges wield substantial discretion
in deciding when and whether to accept a probate bid. You can never
tell for sure where you stand.
An acquaintance of mine tells of a probate property that came up
for sale in an area of $150,000 homes. The probate administrator listed
the house for sale at $115,000. A ﬂurry of bids came in that ranged from
a low of $105,000 up to a high of $118,000. Several months later the
judge looked at the bids, rejected the high bid of
$118,000, and solicited additional offers. Eventually,

arbitrary power.
After all was said and done, the successful
buyer did achieve a bargain price. (Unlike forced
sales “on the courthouse steps,” in a probate sale, you generally can enter
and inspect the properties prior to submitting a bid.) To learn about probate in your area, talk with a probate lawyer or the clerk of the county
court. Also look at local newspapers that announce upcoming probate
sales.

Estate Sales
In some situations, an estate’s assets need not be dragged through the
probate process. You may be able to buy directly from the heirs or the
executor of the estate. In fact, some buyers of estate properties follow
the obituary notices, contact heirs, and try to buy before the property is

cause heirs eagerly want cash. They also may need
the money to pay off a mortgage, other creditors, or
estate taxes. Out-of-town heirs (especially) may not want to hold a vacant property for an extended period until a top-dollar buyer is found.
Once again, pressures of time or money can lead to sales prices that fall
below a property’s market value.

When you contact

Private Auctions
Increasingly, many sellers who want to liquidate their properties turn to
private auctions. During the last economic downturn in California,
banks and thrifts were pooling their REOs and jointly auctioning off
dozens (sometimes hundreds) of properties at a
time. New homebuilders, too, have increased their
use of auctions. Sometimes homebuilder auctions

tempt to raise cash to head off project foreclosure
or company bankruptcy.
In Dallas, a wealthy homeowner tired of trying to sell his $1.6 million (listed price) home through a brokerage ﬁrm and was eager to move
into his newly built $4.4 million home. So he hired an auctioneer. On a
pleasant Saturday morning, hundreds of people showed up and within
minutes of the opening bid, the home had a new owner. The winning
price: $890,000.

Prepare for an Auction
Attend a major real estate auction. You’ll have fun. Often a band is playing, food and drinks are served, and a festive mood prevails. The auction
company wants to make potential bidders feel good. But beyond this dis-

tain level of sales.
To ﬁnd a bargain, don’t get caught up in the festive frenzy and abandon good sense (as the auction company wants you
to). Instead, attend the auction armed with information. Prepare to walk
out a winner—not simply a buyer. Here’s how you can make that happen:
Private auctions

◆ Always thoroughly inspect a property. During the weeks

before most private auctions, the auction company will schedule
open houses at the properties to be sold. If you can’t visit an
open house, contact a real estate agent and ask for a personal
showing. (Most auction companies cooperate with Realtors. If
an agent brings a winning bidder to the auction, that agent is
paid a 1 percent or 2 percent sales commission.) Sometimes auction properties sell cheap because they are nothing more than
teardowns waiting for a bulldozer. Or they may suffer any of a
number of other problems. Even new properties aren’t necessarily defect free. Check them out before you bid.
◆ Appraise the property carefully. Even if free of defects, you
can’t assume value. You must ﬁgure it out by studying recent selling prices of comparable properties. Don’t count on list price to
guide you. Just because you buy a property 25 percent below its
previous listing price doesn’t mean you have bought at 25 percent below the property’s market value.
◆ Set a maximum bid price. Remember, you’re looking for a bargain. Market value tells you what a property might sell for if
ﬁxed up and marketed by a competent and aggressive real estate
agent. Market value does not tell you the price you should bid.
Before the auction, set your maximum bid price. Don’t let the
auctioneer’s “boosters” cajole, excite, romance, bamboozle, or intimidate you into going higher.
◆ Be aware of the buyer’s premium. At many auctions, you will
be required to pay a 5 or 10 percent “buyer’s premium” fee in addition to your bid price.
◆ Review the paperwork that will accompany a successful
bid. Before the auction begins, review the property tax statements, environmental reports, lot survey, legal description, and
the sales contract you’ll be asked to sign.

More Sources of Bargains

161

◆ Learn what type of deed the seller will use to convey the

property. With a general warranty deed, the seller guarantees
clear title subject only to certain named exceptions. Other types
of deeds convey fewer title warranties. Don’t accept a deed without an understanding of its limitations (liens, easements, encroachments, exceptions, missing heirs, etc.). All in all, title
insurance is your best guarantee. If a property’s title is uninsurable, consult a real estate attorney to obtain an opinion of title.
◆ Be prepared to pay the deposit. To become eligible to bid,
register with the auction company before the auction begins and
show proof of deposit funds or cashier’s checks (amount varies
by auction). You then will be issued a bid card that will tell the
auctioneer you are an approved bidder. Without a bid card, the
auctioneer won’t recognize your bid.
◆ Find out if ﬁnancing is available. Often auction companies
prearrange ﬁnancing on some or all of their properties. If so, ﬁnd
out the terms and qualifying standards. If not, determine how
much time the auction company gives you to arrange your own
ﬁnancing. Unlike most government agency property auctions,
private auction companies typically do not expect their successful bidders to pay cash for their properties.
◆ Learn whether the sale is absolute or subject to a reserve
price. Usually auction properties are either offered absolute or
with reserve. If absolute, a property is sold no matter how low
the top bidder’s price. With a reserve price, the top bid must exceed a prearranged minimum amount or the property is pulled
out of the auction. On occasion, though, the owner of a property
may “nod” to the auctioneer and approve a bid that does not
meet the reserve price.

How to Find Auctions
Most auction companies advertise their upcoming auctions in local and
sometimes national newspapers (such as the Wall Street Journal ). Auction companies not only want to attract as many bidders as possible,
they want to draw large crowds so they can create a sense of anticipation and excitement. In addition to advertising, most auction companies
will place your name on their mailing lists.
Local auction companies are listed in the phone book. Large-scale
auctions, though, are frequently handled by auction companies that

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

162

operate nationwide. These include Fisher Auction Company, Hudson &
Marshall, JP King, Kennedy-Wilson, Larry Latham, NRC Auctions, Ross
Dove & Company, and Sheldon Good & Company. Even if you decide not
to bid, large auctions are fun to attend. Try one. Plus, you’ll learn the
tricks of the trade as you watch the professional auctioneers and investors vie with one another.

Short Sale Bargains
Up to this point, you’ve discovered multiple ways to ﬁnd properties that
you can buy at a bargain price. You’ve learned about motivated sellers,
foreclosures, REOs, auctions, probate, and estate sales. Now, you’re going
to see how to create a bargain price by negotiating with a lienholder. Investors call this technique a short sale.

Unfortunately, without a job, you can no longer make your mortgage payments. Nor is it likely that you can reﬁnance. Your lender threatens to foreclose. Your situation looks bleak.
Lender, Too, Faces Bleak (Money-Losing) Outcome The lender is
threatening to foreclose, but it doesn’t really want to. If the lender forecloses, it will surely lose money.
In your present difﬁcult situation, you owe the lender a total of
$280,000 (mortgage balance, missed payments). If the lender goes
through foreclosure, it will want to collect not only this $280,000, but
also numerous other costs such as . . .

◆ Court costs
◆ Lost interest
◆ Property insurance premiums
◆ Property tax payments
◆ Miscellaneous costs (staff time, property upkeep, paperwork,

property, the lender loses around $100,000.

Alternatively, the lender may choose not to let the property go to a foreclosure speculator. It could shut out the speculators with a bid of
$300,001. If the lender wins its bid, it then owns the property as an REO.
Does acquiring the REO solve the lender’s problem? No. The lender
will continue to lose interest earnings on the money it has put out
thus far on the property. Plus, it must still pay property taxes, premiums for property insurance, propREOs don’t end the

Lenders Lose with REOs After all of these efforts and costs, will the
lender eventually come out ahead with its REO? Still, the answer is no.
Remember, at most, the property will bring a price of $265,000. Here’s
how the numbers might look.

Even with the REO alternative, the lender loses $65,900 (and that
assumes an REO sale at full market value—which is not likely). So, ask
yourself if, as an investor, you could work out a way for lenders with bad
loans to lose less money. Would the lender accept your solution? In many
instances, the answer to that question is yes.
The Pre-Foreclosure Workout What if, before the lender ﬁled foreclosure on a bad loan, you could get the lender to accept a short payoff—some amount less than the total balance the borrower owes? Quite
likely you could save the lender from losing as much money as it otherwise would by going through with its foreclosure. You would help the
borrowers salvage what’s left of their credit record. (Late payments
don’t bring down a credit score nearly as much as would a foreclosure.)
What’s in it for you? You acquire a property for less than its market
value. Let’s go back to the earlier example at the point in time when the
borrowers owed $280,000—only now we’ll assume that you’re the investor.

with the proviso that you can work out a short payoff on their loan with

ﬁnd nothing but Carleton Sheets and Ron Popiel infomercials. The
lender loses only $50,000, instead of the $65,900 (or more) that it would
have lost by foreclosing the borrowers and eventually ending up with
another REO that it does not want.
As for you, the investor, you’ve just become the owner of a
$265,000 property for an outlay of $230,001. Everybody comes out
ahead.

How to Actually Complete a Short Sale
To complete a short sale, you will typically need to negotiate well and
diligently persevere. To earn your gain of $25,000 to $100,000 from this

can take to beat the odds.
Find Sellers in Financial Distress (or Otherwise Motivated to
Deal) To complete a short sale, you ﬁrst need to ﬁnd sellers who are ﬁnancially distressed or otherwise eager to cut a deal that frees them from
their property and their mortgage obligations. How can you ﬁnd these
motivated sellers?
You’ve got dozens of possibilities. Just revisit all of the techniques
we’ve discussed so far, and especially those shown in Box 9.1. Remember, every day some people’s lives change to make property ownership a
burden. When you ﬁgure out a way to relieve that burden, you help the
sellers and you help yourself.
Review the Sellers’ Mortgage Payment Records After you’ve established rapport with the sellers and set the tone for productive discussions, you need to review their mortgage payment records and all
collection letters thus far sent by their lender. Speciﬁcally, you want to
learn:
◆ The current payoff amount on the loan including all back pay-

ments, late fees, and legal fees assessed by the lender (if any).

166

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

◆ Where the lender is in its collection efforts. In my experience,

I’ve found lenders are more inclined to complete a short sale
when the borrowers have missed multiple monthly payments.
The borrowers are so seriously delinquent that the lender believes the property will almost certainly end up in foreclosure.
◆ How the full amount the borrowers owe compares with the
likely selling price of their mortgaged property.
◆ Whether it appears that a foreclosure will lose the lender a lot of
money, after adding in continued lost interest and other expenses. If so, you’ve located a hot prospect for a short payoff.
Review the Sellers’ Total Financial Picture Before a lender will accept a short payoff, the borrowers must prove destitution. By destitution, I don’t mean that the borrowers will soon be living on food stamps
in the back of their car. But the lender will probe to determine whether
the borrowers own any valuable assets that they
could sell to raise money.
The lender also will look at the borrowers’

think their position).
Place the Property Under Contract When your preliminary talks
and investigation show that the borrowers really can’t pay and that the
lender is heading toward big losses, get the property under contract.
Offer the sellers some token amount ($1) in exchange for a deed
to their property. In addition, you agree to permanently get the lender
off their backs. By doing so, you save the sellers’ credit and restore
their peace of mind (at least as it relates to this imminent foreclosure).
However, because at this point you don’t know whether the lender
will accept a short payoff, you must also include a contingency in your
offer to the sellers that reads something like this:
This agreement between
you
and
sellers
is subject to

by lender for an amount not to exceed $

The maximum amount you actually commit to pay the lender will
depend on the amount of proﬁt you plan to earn and the riskiness of the
property (current condition, certainty with which you can achieve your
desired selling price). Do not agree to pay the sellers any real money, because the lender won’t approve it. Only rarely will a lender permit borrowers to put cash in their own pocket from a sale when at the same
time the lender agrees to take a loss.
Obtain Permission to Negotiate with the Lender At the time the
sellers accept your offer, you also will get them to sign a form that authorizes the lender to release the sellers’ loan information to you. This form allows you to verify all of the mortgage payment data
that the sellers have provided you. Plus, it gives the
lender authority to negotiate a payoff with you.
Lenders require

need for this release. Without it, you’re just shooting
blanks.
Approach the Lender When you ﬁrst approach the lender, do not—
I repeat, do not—even suggest the mortgage payoff price that you have
in mind. During this preliminary meeting (most probably with a staff ofﬁcer in the lender’s loss mitigation department), learn the lender’s views
about short payoffs. Learn the criteria the lender applies. Learn the
lender’s standard policies and operating procedures.
Different lenders try to settle their bad loans in different ways.

offs can beneﬁt the lender.)
Prepare and Submit Your Offer You’ve opened discussions with
the lender and gathered information about its payoff policies. Ideally,
during these talks, the lender will have given you clues as to how much
discount it’s willing to accept. (Regardless, though, always offer far less

168

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

than you’re willing to pay.) You’re now ready to prepare and submit an
offer.
But wait. You don’t want to just give the lender a number. In most
instances, you will need to ﬁrst build your case. You will need to submit
a full package of persuasive evidence. This package should include:
◆ Cover letter. Here’s where you lay out in summary form all of

the evidence that you’ve submitted to prove why a short payoff
now will beneﬁt the lender. However, do not put precise ﬁgures
in this letter. Build up the merits of the idea before you start talking numbers. Talk beneﬁts before price.
◆ Condition of the property. Take as many unﬂattering photos
of the property as you can. Submit those that look the worst.
Also, submit repair cost estimates (as high as you can reasonably
justify).
◆ Comparable sales. Choose the lowest-priced, best-looking
comparable sale properties that you can ﬁnd. Use these comp
sales to support the lowest possible estimate of market value for
the mortgaged property. The less the lender thinks the property
will bring at foreclosure (or as an REO), the more willing it will
be to accept your short-sale offer.
◆ Owner distress pleas. In this part of the offering package, you
will include a hardship letter from the borrowers. This letter will
explain all of the tough times these folks are experiencing. For
support, include those threatening letters the borrowers have received from the IRS, those large unpaid medical bills, the electricity cutoff notice from the utility company, and the newspaper
article that explains why 400 laid-off workers at the local textile
plant (where both of the borrowers worked) will never be called
back.
◆ Credibility. As in all negotiations, provide evidence to the
lender that as soon as the lender accepts your offer, you are
ready, willing, and able to close. Prove to the lender that you will
perform as promised.
◆ Your offer. On this ﬁnal page of your package, calculate the
amount of losses the lender will suffer if it continues the foreclosure process. Then, show your bid payoff amount. The ﬁgures
should show that the lender will net more if it acts now to accept your offer.

More Sources of Bargains

169

◆ Persistently follow up. Do not get discouraged if the lender

doesn’t immediately respond to your offer. Follow up, follow up,
follow up. If the lender won’t accept, then weasel, cajole, or persuade the loss mitigation ofﬁcer to suggest a number that might
look good. Do whatever you can to keep the dialogue alive.
Coming Up with the Money To maximize the attractiveness of your
offer to the lender, talk cash. Lenders typically prefer to cash out their
bad loans. Rarely would a lender agree to a discounted payoff and carryback ﬁnancing. (Yet, if necessary, you can still ask.)
How can you raise this money if you don’t already have it? Return
to Chapters 3–8. Given the bargain deal that you’ve just negotiated, you
should be able to easily ﬂip the property to another buyer (who has the
cash to close), secure low- (or no-) down-payment ﬁnancing from another lender, or bring in a money partner.
With a near-sure proﬁt from the transaction, you will ﬁnd the
money. Nevertheless, don’t wait to the last minute. Not only do you need
to prove your credibility in your bid package, but after a lender accepts
your offer you can’t delay. Line up a sure source of cash before you submit your bid.

In this chapter, you’re going to see some easy ways to ﬁgure out whether
a property you’re looking at will really give you a great buy. If your property looks good on all (or even most) of these benchmarks, you’re almost
certain to make a lot of money.
◆ The construction cycle
◆ Per-unit measures
◆ Gross rent multipliers
◆ Capitalized value
◆ Cash ﬂow returns
◆ Potential for creating value

After you learn these value benchmarks, you’ll see that contrary to
popular belief, at times you can achieve a great return plus a margin of
safety—even if you pay above market value.
The trick, of course, is to know what you’re doing and why you’re
doing it. Too many beginning investors merely chase after “belowmarket” buys, and reject in knee-jerk fashion all properties priced at or
above market. Instead, as a savvy, entrepreneurial investor, you’ll want to
run your potential buys through a variety of ﬁnancial tests. High passing
grades will tell you when you’ve really found a property that will prove
to be a star performer.
Certainly, buying below market can give you a great bargain. But
that’s not the only way to score a good deal.

Follow the Construction Cycle
When you invest, you expect to proﬁt as the property appreciates in
value. Over the long run, as construction costs go up and population increases, property values nearly always increase. In the short run, though,
current market values sometimes jump too far above construction costs.

perfect time to buy.

How to Proﬁt from the Construction Cycle
Here’s how the construction cycle works: Typically, a city, town, or vacation area begins to boom. Jobs and wages go up. More people move in.
Interest rates decline. Apartment rents and home prices climb higher.
Apartment vacancies disappear. The number of homes up for sale begins
to decline. Pretty soon, existing houses or apartments that could be constructed new for say, $100,000 per unit begin to command prices of, say,
$120,000, $130,000 or more.

Builders Spy Opportunity
With prices of existing properties well above their construction costs,
builders can quickly make a lot of money. Build at $100,000; sell at
$130,000. Great! $30,000 proﬁt. Naturally, too many builders rush in to
grab a pile of proﬁts. Because of these optimistic
builder expectations, the supply of new homes

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

Recovery Over time, banks pull back their mortgage lending. Builders
sharply cut their new developments. Rental vacancies begin to tighten;
the number of unsold homes begins to fall. Potential renters and homebuyers again outnumber the supply of available properties. Property
prices and rents stabilize and then edge up. Eventually, as shortages
again loom on the horizon, vacancies fall further. Prices take off on another rapid run-up. The construction cycle turns another revolution.
Prices set new record highs.

Implications for Investors
The classic major boom-bust construction cycle occurred in Texas in
the mid to late 1980s. Properties that could be built new for $75,000
to $100,000 sold for as much as $125,000 to $150,000. Condominium
and apartment projects multiplied like dandelions after an April rain.
Back then, large real estate tax shelter beneﬁts added fuel to the ﬁre. In
a situation similar to the dot-coms and tech stocks in the late 1990s,
rapid price increases fed on themselves—until the real estate bubble
burst.
Pitfalls Could Texas investors have avoided getting caught in this
downdraft? Absolutely. Had they kept an eye on construction costs, they
could have anticipated problems. For whenever the market prices of
properties push more than 10 to 15 percent ahead

or buy only when they can get their price—not the
inﬂated (and soon-to-be-deﬂated) market price.
The moral: Stay in touch with local builders or others who are in
the know about contractor costs (building suppliers, lumber yards, real
estate appraisers, building contractors, construction lenders). Also, you
might consult one or more construction cost services. You can easily follow your local building costs through cost manuals (at your library) or
websites. When builder proﬁt margins grow ever fatter, oversupply becomes a real threat.

when market prices end up below replacement costs. Because that
means few builders will build. Builders will not knowingly pay more to
build a house than they can get from its selling price.

Have Money, Will Travel Will local or regional shakeouts occur in
the future? Probably. Although builders and construction lenders have
supposedly entered a new era of disciplined building and lending, that
story’s been told before. It seems that each generation forgets the mistakes of the past. They must relearn the lessons taught in earlier years.

gains don’t come to you, then, as a entrepreneurial
investor, prepare to go to the bargains.

Local (Regional) Recessions
Even without serious overbuilding, property prices can sometimes fall
below replacement costs due to job declines and recession. During the early
1990s, large layoffs in the defense and aerospace industry created the housing troubles experienced in Southern California. But as with Texas and New
York City, the Southern California economy had to bounce back. And when
it did, we witnessed a great boom in property prices. Follow the real estate
cycle and you, too, can earn those big bucks that recovery brings about.

Per-Unit Measures
In addition to tuning in to the construction cycle, savvy real estate investors rely on various per-unit measures to help them decide whether a

vestments.

Per Apartment Unit
When you look at multiunit apartment buildings, divide the asking price
by the number of apartment units in the property. For example, for an
eight-unit property priced at $450,000, you would calculate:
$450,000
8
price per unit = $56,250

price per unit =

If you know that other similar apartment buildings have typically sold
for $60,000 to $70,000 per unit, you may have found a bargain. This and
other per-unit measures also give you a quick way to compare prices
when rental properties differ in the number of their units. Say you’re
comparing a 6-unit, a 9-unit, and an 11-unit property at the respective
prices of $275,000, $435,000, and $487,500. By ﬁguring per-unit prices,
you can easily rank the properties from the lowest priced to the highest.

Although I’m not trying to push you into the “analysis paralysis” so
common in MBA programs, do try to spot those “differences that make
a difference.” When you use a checklist to compare building features,
you can better rank properties according to their
proﬁt potential. (See the checklist at my website,
stoprentingnow.com.)
Arbitrage your
investments. Buy
in one market, sell
in another.

Opportunity Knocks (Arbitrage) Primarily,
price-per-unit measures can help you ﬁnd “bargain”
buildings. But this measure can also help you spot
opportunities in two other ways:

◆ Size. Change the size of the units from larger to smaller, or vice

versa. Imagine that smaller 700- to 800-square-foot units sell and
rent at substantial premiums over larger units of 1,200 to 1,400
square feet. So, if you buy a building of predominantly larger
units, you could earn a big payoff when you redesign the building’s space into smaller units.
◆ Conversion. You might also proﬁt by noticing that buildings
with two-bedroom rentals typically sell in the $40,000 to
$50,000 per-unit range. Yet, in similar condo buildings, twobedroom units sell in the $70,000 to $80,000 range. Or this price
difference might appear in the opposite direction. Either way,
you may be able to buy at the lower-priced use, convert, then sell
(or rent) at the high-priced use.
Although arbitrage opportunities don’t occur everyday, they do
come up every now and then. So, pay attention to relative prices. Prepare to jump when you can buy a building at a low price and then convert it to a use that sells at a higher price.

Per-Square-Foot (p.s.f.) Measures
You’ve probably heard property buyers and sellers remark that a property sold for say, $135 per square foot. Price per square foot (p.s.f.)
represents one of the most widely used methods of benchmark pricing. Investors and homebuyers alike rely on it to ballpark values.
When you calculate a per-square-foot ﬁgure, you simply divide the

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

176

total square footage of the unit (house, apartment, or total building)
into its price:
p.s.f. =

asking price
square footage

p.s.f. =

$285, 000
1, 900

p.s.f. = $150

If comparable sale properties typically have sold at $170 to $180
p.s.f., a price of $150 p.s.f. may represent a great bargain.
Unfortunately, naive investors can go wrong using per-square-foot
ﬁgures because no uniform standards apply. All square feet are not created equal in terms of quality, design, and usability. So calculate p.s.f. ﬁgures with caution. For example, unless designed with market appeal,
converted garages, basements, and attics are worth
far less per square foot than a property’s original living areas.
Not all square

room sizes far out of proportion to each other, or to
competing properties.

Gross Rent Multipliers (GRMs)
To value rental houses and small apartment buildings, you can also divide
the property’s price by its total (gross) rent collections. As shown below,this
calculation gives you a gross rent multiplier. Consider these market data:

If you ﬁnd an income property with a relatively high GRM, it

As a rule, when annual gross rent multipliers
go much above 8.0, you’re often looking at negative cash ﬂows—unless
you increase your down payment to 30 percent or more.1 Because big

of 10 or higher, cash-ﬂow investors who live in those areas should buy

of the rents.

Capitalized Value
As you’ve already seen, you can also appraise an income property by ﬁguring its capitalized value:
V=

NOI
R

Where V represents the estimated market value of the property, NOI (net
operating income) represents the property’s rents less expenses, and R
equals the market capitalization rate. To illustrate, here’s how this technique would look for a six-unit apartment building:

You can easily compute NOI. But, if you’re not careful, you can still
err. To alert you to these possible traps, think about the following warnings (which match up numerically with the entries shown on the income statement):
1. Gross potential rents. For this ﬁgure, use the property’s existing rent levels. If its current rents sit above market, use market rent levels. Verify all leases for rental amounts and lease
terms. Do not use a rent ﬁgure based on your anticipated rent
increases (if any).
2. Extra income. With many properties, you can charge for
rental application fees, parking, storage, laundry, party room,
garages, and so on. Verify all of this income. Don’t count extra
income that’s not been proven by past operating experience
or reasonable market data.
3. Vacancy and collection losses. Use market vacancy rates,
or the current owner’s vacancies for the past year—
whichever is higher. Also, when judging market vacancy rates,
take your ﬁgures from the market niche in which this prop-

erty currently operates. Vacancy rates may vary signiﬁcantly
by neighborhood, apartment size, quality, and rent level. As
you compare vacancy rates by market niche, try to spot those
segments that are experiencing the greatest shortages.
Effective gross income. It is from this cash that you will
pay property expenses and mortgage payments. If you overestimate rent levels or underestimate vacancies, you may end
up cash-short.
Trash pick-up. Verify rates and permissible quantities. Look
for lower-cost alternatives.
Utilities. In addition to common area lighting, some buildings
include centralized heat and air systems. Verify the amounts of
these expenses with utility companies.
License and permit fees. On occasion, owners of rental properties are required to pay municipal fees of one sort or another.
Lease-up expenses. Ideally, you will generate a good supply
of rental applicants from free postings, referrals, and inquiries;
otherwise, you may need to advertise. Also, you’ll probably
need to pay for credit checks on potential tenants.

Miscellaneous. You will incur such odds-and-ends expenses
as lease preparation, auto mileage, and long-distance telephone charges.
Property taxes. Verify amount, tax rate, and assessed value.
Check accuracy. Note whether the property is subject to any
special assessments (sewer, sidewalks, water reclamation).
Property and liability insurance. Verify exact coverage for
property and types of losses. Increase deductibles and limits
on liability.

Estimate Market Value
After ﬁguring NOI, you next need to come up with an accurate capitalization rate (R). To ﬁgure this cap rate, compare the NOIs (net operating
incomes) of similar properties to their selling prices. You can get this information when you talk with realty agents who regularly sell (and
preferably own) small rental properties, or from
other investors (a local realty investment club, for

Mum’s the Word: Don’t Tell Sellers Your Plans
Beginning investors, especially, tend to reveal too much of their plans
for a property. To gain a bargain price, don’t turn your cards so that
the sellers (or their sales agent) can see them. If you explicitly question the sellers in ways that reveal your value-creating ideas, the sellers will likely use that potential to strengthen their own negotiating
position.

you. As much as possible, negotiate for the property
as it currently is operated. Reap any future upside as your bonus for entrepreneurial insights.

Cash Flow Returns
In addition to market value, you should also judge your properties by
the cash ﬂow returns they will yield. To illustrate, let’s bring forward
that six-unit apartment building from several pages back. Assume you
can buy that property for $350,000 (around $60,000 per unit). You talk
to a lender and tentatively arrange a mortgage for $280,000 (an 80 percent loan-to-value ratio). The lender wants an 8.0 percent interest rate
with a 25-year term. You would need to put $70,000 down. Here are the
relevant ﬁgures:

Not bad. But say your minimum required return (hurdle rate)
equals 15 percent. What might you do to boost your cash ﬂow returns?
For starters, you could try to get the lender to extend the loan term to 30
years. If successful, your payments (assuming no change in interest rate)
would drop to $24,652 a year; your annual pretax cash ﬂow would increase to $10,688 (35,340 minus 24,652):

Cash flow return =

$10,688
$70,000

= 15.3%

If you don’t like extending the loan term to 30 years, you could try to
push the lender down to a 7.625 percent interest rate. In that case, your
mortgage payments (25 years) would total $25,102 per year. Your cash
ﬂow would equal $10,237 (35,340 – 25,102):

Cash flow return =

$10,237
$70,000

= 14.28%

Oops, that lower interest rate won’t quite do it. But as an enterprising investor, you’ve got a number of other options:
◆ Try for an even lower interest rate (7.5 percent would work).
◆ Ask the seller to take back an interest-only balloon note for ﬁve

years at 7.0 percent in the amount of, say, $20,000.
◆ Negotiate a lower price for the property.

adjustable-rate mortgage.This tactic would work especially well if
you planned to sell (or exchange) the property within ﬁve years.
◆ Look for reasonable and certain ways to boost the property’s net
income. Increase rent collections, raise occupancy. Cut expenses.
◆ Agree to pay the seller a higher price in exchange for owner ﬁnancing on terms more favorable (lower interest rate, lower
down payment) than a bank would offer.

ﬁnancing, property improvements, and market strategy that you put together.

Don’t Settle for Market Rates of Appreciation: Create Value

Yes, I love to buy properties that score high on all of the value
benchmarks that you’ve just learned. But just as much—and sometimes
more—I love to buy properties that include large doses of hidden value,
value that I can bring to life through market-researched, proﬁt-yielding
improvements. In fact, in sellers’ markets (when too many buyers are
chasing too few properties), it’s often easier to discover hidden value

below-market prices.

How You Can Greatly
Increase the Value of
Your Investment Property

Want to immediately jump your net worth by $25,000, $100,000,
$250,000, or more? Then put to work this simple method for ﬁguring out
the value of a property:
Value =

Net Operating Income (NOI)
Capitalization Rate (R)

To refresh your memory, let’s go through another example. Assume that
you ﬁnd a six-unit apartment building. This rental property currently
brings in a net income (NOI) of $48,000 a year. Based on talks with real
estate agents, appraisers, and other investors, you ﬁgure this property “as
is”should sell with a cap rate of 9 percent (.09). With these two numbers
you can calculate the “as is” value of these six units at $533,333.
48, 000 (NOI)
= $533, 333 (V)
.09 (R)

If you could somehow boost that property’s NOI to say, $60,000 a year,
you would jump its value by 25 percent. You would quickly gain another
$133,000 in equity.
185

186

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

60, 000 (new NOI)
= $666, 666 (V)
.09 (R)

Even better, if you can reduce the riskiness of the property, you might be
able to justify a lower cap rate than .09, say, 8 percent (.08). With a
higher NOI and a lower cap rate, the value of that property skyrockets
from the original $533,333 up to $750,000—an immediate gain in value
of $212,000.
Are such large increases in value possible within a period of 6 to 18
months? Absolutely! Why? Because many owners of small investment
properties still think of themselves as “landlords” (with the accent on
“lord”) and their residents merely as “renters” who don’t deserve “customer care.” But just the opposite is true. Today (and in the future) market conditions require savvy investors to treat their tenants as valued
customers—not serfs.

your proﬁts (and the value of your properties) will
shoot far above average for two reasons:

1. Better resident relations. The residents of your properties
will reward you with lower turnover, fewer problems, and
higher rents.
2. Alert to opportunities. With a customer-oriented, constantimprovement attitude, you will consistently look for and come
up with ideas that will add value to your property operations.

A Strategy of Your Own
Good management and marketing depend on good knowledge of competing properties and resident (tenant) preferences. You want to create
a speciﬁc strategy that will yield you the highest proﬁts. Certainly, you
can read a dozen books on “landlording” and most of them will give you
a precise list of do’s and don’ts that may cover every topic from applications to waterbeds. While ideas from these books often prove suggestive, never accept them as the ﬁnal word.

sive buildings. Should you accept pets, smokers, or
college students? It all depends.
Offer your selected target market of renters (or buyers) the value
proposition that they will prefer—yet, at the same time, a value proposition that fattens your bottom line (NOI). In practice, you can ﬁnd that
proﬁt-maximizing value proposition by knowing the competition. Then
create your own competitive advantage.
Here’s the $100,000 question: What can you actually do to boost
your property’s investment value? Here are some ideas.

First, Verify Actual Rent Collections, Not Merely Rental Rates
Before you buy, verify. Too many new investors merely accept an owner’s
rent ﬁgures and then subtract a so-called standard 5 percent vacancy factor. In truth, many property owners do not collect 95 percent of their
scheduled rents—even if they achieve 95 percent occupancy. To verify

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

188

rents, ﬁrst verify the lease rates the tenants have agreed to pay. Second,
realistically estimate vacancy and collection losses. Your proﬁts, and the
building’s value, rest upon bankable funds, not leaky leases. If you overpay for a property because you overestimate the property’s current rent
collections, you are trying to increase value in a headwind.

Talk with Tenants
Prior to buying any investment property, I always talk with a sampling of
the renters who live in the building. This practice serves four purposes.
◆ Identify problems in the building.
◆ Identify problems with tenants.
◆ Verify lease application data.
◆ Generate ideas for improvement.

Problems in the Building
“Not enough parking.”“Too much noise.”“The bills for heat and air are
outrageous—$277 last month.”“These walls are paper thin.”“This place
lacks security. We’ve had three break-ins during the past six months.”
“The closets in this apartment are too small, and there’s no place for
long-term storage.”“No place to park or store my boat—or even my bicycle.”“Cockroaches, ugh. This place is crawling with cockroaches.”
To really learn about a building, talk with the tenants. You can gain
valuable insights by asking tenants,“Tell me, what don’t you like around
here?”On occasion, the tenants will speak well of the
building (or its owner). But more often they like to

bring on a rent increase.

Problems with Tenants
Bad tenants can ruin a potentially good building. If some tenants create
hassles for others, you want to know about it before you offer to buy the

How You Can Greatly Increase the Value of Your Investment Property

189

property. Problems within a building and problems with disruptive tenants can stir up vacancies, turnover, and rent collections. Solve these
problems and you create value.

Verify Lease and Application Data
Leases and tenant application data do not always portray the true facts
about a property’s tenants. Do you realize that some sellers actually
show beginning investors phantom leases with false data? Aside from
outright fraud, your talks with tenants might reveal rent concessions that
aren’t recorded in the written ﬁle that the sellers gave you to review. You
might also ﬁnd that some tenants are subletting their units. Or maybe
they’ve let additional friends and family move in
with them.

Set Your Rents with Market Savvy
Many owners of rental properties devote far too little effort to ﬁguring out
the rental rates that they should charge for their units. They underprice.

190

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

They overprice. They don’t make rent-enhancing improvements. They fail
to adequately segment their tenants. They spend too much money on ineffective advertising. They devote too little time and money to target marketing. If they experience high vacancies, they blame a soft market. If they
experience low vacancies,they pride themselves on their skill as a landlord.
All in all, these mistakes (and many others) ﬂow from the same
source. Property owners just don’t realize the great proﬁts they’re missing when they set their rents to reﬂect their own
personal whim or arbitrary judgment rather than
market reality.
Mispricing your

Move that rent shortfall up to $50 or $100 a month, and you lose
$100,000 to $200,000. Make no mistake: Underpricing rents can cost
you a bundle of money. Overpricing, too, can also cost you plenty. By trying to charge too much, your vacancies, turnovers, advertising costs, conversion rates (meaning that you must show the property 15 to 20 times
before you ﬁnd a willing tenant), malicious tenant damage, and bad debts
will probably shoot up. Before you set your rent rates, inspect competing properties. Acquire personal knowledge of competing properties
and competitor pricing.Then you will be able to adopt a pricing strategy
that maximizes your net income (NOI) and property value.

Give the Interior a Martha Stewart Makeover
As you walk into the unit, are you met with a bland neutrality? Do you
see faded paint, scuff marks, outdated color schemes, cheap hollowcore doors, nail holes in the walls, worn carpeting, torn linoleum, oldfashioned light ﬁxtures, cracked wall switch plates, or stained toilets,
bathtubs, and sinks? If you answer yes to any or all of these questions,
great! You’ve found the easiest path to creating value.

Pay Special Attention to Kitchens and Baths
To really wow your potential tenants, bring in Martha Stewart to redo
the kitchens and bathrooms. Flip through the pages of kitchen and bath
magazines. Look for that right combination of materials and colors that
will create a light, bright, cheerful, and inviting look. Eliminate those
harvest-gold appliances, the chipped and stained sinks, and that cracked
glass in the shower door.
As you inspect these key rooms, focus on each of the following features for at least 30 seconds:
❑ Floors
❑ Ceilings
❑ Sinks
❑ Toilet bowl
❑ Windows and window sills
❑ Electrical outlet plates
❑ Lighting

❑ Faucets
❑ Walls
❑ Cabinets
❑ Cabinet and drawer handles
❑ Appliances
❑ Counter tops

By focusing for 30 seconds on each feature of these rooms, you will
notice everything that blends together to give these rooms their overall
feel. Throughout the entire apartment or house, details count. But they
especially count in the kitchens and bathrooms. The right pizzazz in the
kitchens and bathrooms can transform a ho-hum
unit into a showplace.

$2,000 and $5,000. Replacing sinks, hardware, toilet bowls, and toilet
seats requires relatively little money. As to the cabinetry itself, often a
lower-cost reﬁnish (not a full replacement) can work wonders.

Cleanliness Generates Proﬁts
Do you want to attract tenants who will care for your properties? Then
thoroughly clean the units as if a drill sergeant were about to perform a
white-glove inspection. Do not think “rental property.” Think “home.”
Clean everywhere. Remove the dirt, dust, cobwebs, and dead bugs from all corners, baseboards,

debris. Make sure all windows and mirrors sparkle
and shine. Look closely for grime in the shower and
shower door tracks. Scrape the rust out of the medicine cabinets and repaint where necessary. Eliminate all odors. Each unit should not only
look fresh and clean, it should smell fresh and clean.

Natural Light and Views
If your units seem dark, brighten them up. In addition to color schemes,
add windows or skylights. If you’re lucky, you might ﬁnd one of those
older buildings with 10-foot ceilings—now reduced to 8 feet via suspended acoustical tile. For a reason unknown to me (energy conservation?), dropped ceilings became popular in the
1960s and 1970s. Today, they’re considered ugly and

with high ceilings, you can install clerestory windows to bring in more light.
For ﬁrst-ﬂoor rooms, see if you can enhance the view with landscaping or fencing. To create views for upper-story units, think long
term. Plant trees. When ﬁnancially feasible, you might create a view by
moving a window. Ugly views turn off most tenants. Pleasant views provide good selling points. Do as much as you can to give your tenants better views than dumpsters, parking lots, high-trafﬁc streets, and the
rooftops of other buildings.

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

194

Special Touches
For those special aesthetic touches, try chair railings, wallpaper borders,
upgraded door handles, paneled doors, and wood stains (instead of
paint). Upgrades in light ﬁxtures, too, can help you add pizzazz. The
newer forms of track lighting seem to be gaining popularity for both
form and function.
You can get ideas for special touches from home decorating and remodeling magazines. Also visit new model homes and newer upscale

remember your units.

Safety, Security, and Convenience
Often safety and convenience go together as with the number and capacity of electrical outlets. Older buildings, especially, lack enough outlets and amperage to safely handle all of the modern household’s plug-in
appliances, computers, printers, fax machines, and audio/video home entertainment centers. Many renters don’t notice this type of functional
obsolescence until after they move into a unit. Then they “solve” the
problem with adapter plugs and roaming extension cords. If the unit
lacks electrical capacity, plan an upgrade.

Other Issues of Safety and Security
Get an expert to
assess the risks of
an
environmentally
suspect property.

Other safety issues include smoke alarms, carbon
monoxide detectors, ﬁre escape routes, door locks,
ﬁrst-ﬂoor windows, and ﬁrst-ﬂoor sliding glass
doors. Environmental health hazards may exist because of lead paint, asbestos, or formaldehyde—any
of which may be found in building materials used in
construction (or remodeling) prior to 1978. When
buying, insist on seller disclosures about the pres-

How You Can Greatly Increase the Value of Your Investment Property

195

ence of any of these hazards. If the building is suspect, don’t buy it without advice of an environmental expert.
Costly remedial improvements in these areas will seldom pay off
with much higher rents. You can, though, proﬁtably deal with environmental issues by negotiating a large discount in your purchase price. As
to security against break-ins, make sure all windows and doors lock securely and cannot be jimmied with a credit card (as in the TV shows), or
even a screwdriver. Deadbolt locks are best. Entry-door peepholes also
give tenants a sense of security.
In our criminal-infested world, tenants want to feel safe in their
homes. If doors, door locks, and windows seem ﬂimsy, many tenants
won’t rent the unit—regardless of its other oohs and aahs.

Stairs, Carpets, and Bathrooms
Pay particular attention to any steps or stair railings that may be loose or
dangerous. Frayed carpets and bathtubs that lack no-slip bottoms and
handrails can provoke falls. Remedy every safety or security hazard
within the property. Even when a repair doesn’t add
to your rent collections, it will protect your tenants.
Unsafe properties

invite lawsuits.

Rightsize the Rooms
Have you ever walked into a house and found some rooms too large and
others too small? It seems today that in many houses builders construct
a huge great room along with a huge master bedroom and bath, and then
ﬁnish off the house with three or four dinky bedrooms. The house lacks
a sense of proportion (which evidently is what some homebuyers like).

Create a Sense of Proportion
What sense of proportion should a house or an apartment unit display?
The answer varies by tenant segment, price range, and timing (because

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

196

tastes today differ from those of 10, 20, or 30 years ago). As people and
property change, opportunities arise for you to notice possibilities for
improvement. Buy an out-of-style building, then rearrange the internal
ﬂoor plan to better appeal to the intended market segment of renters or
buyers.

Postwar Units Are Modernized
I once bought an older eight-unit apartment building. It had been built
in 1949 to house the veterans of World War II and their fast-growing families. The units were arranged in a “3BR/1BTH” style (common to that period) with one moderate-sized bedroom for the parents and two small
bedrooms for those recently born baby boomers. In the early 1990s
(when I bought the property), most tenants looked at the units and said,
“Ugh, no way could we live here.”
Because the owner had trouble keeping the units rented, I got a
bargain price. To create value, I split up one of the small bedrooms. I
used half of that space to enlarge the other small bedroom, and half to
add a second bathroom. I then rented the building to tenants looking to
share their rentals with a roommate. Rent collections jumped by $175
per unit per month—a very proﬁtable return on my investment and renovations.

Create More Storage
Self-storage (mini-warehouses) now represent one of the fastest growing
types of properties in the United States. We’ve all become pack rats.
“Throw it away? Why I might need that sometime.”
Talk with tenants. Talk with homeowners. Many will tell you the
same thing. “I like my home, but we lack space for storage.” If you want
to add appeal to your rental houses and apartment units, add storage
space. To do so, think about storage in three ways:
◆ Bring dead space to life.
◆ Increase the capacity of existing space.
◆ Create new storage space in basements or attics. Install storage

sheds.

Bring Dead Space to Life
Let me ﬁrst illustrate with an example that may seem trivial, but it never
fails to mildly impress prospective tenants. Look in the cabinet under
your kitchen sink. You will see a small gap between the front panel of
the cabinet above the door and the sink. In other words, dead space.
How might you use that space? Install a small pull-down compartment
to stow away soap, sponge, and scrubbing pads. No more sink clutter.
Whenever I show this little innovation to other people, I always get an
approving response.
Okay, I admit, it’s trivial. But it illustrates the point. All houses and
apartments include generous amounts of dead spaces (large and small)
that you can bring to life.
◆ Under stairs and stairwells
◆ Bay windows with storage built under the window seat and

under the outside of the window
◆ Garden windows
◆ On the tops of kitchen cabinets
◆ Dead-end cabinets
◆ Walls suitable for shelving
◆ Recessed storage between studs (as with an in-wall medicine

chest)
◆ Kitchen hanging bars for pots and pans

These ideas merely sample the possibilities. If you go through any house
or apartment and ask,“Where are the dead spaces that I can bring to life
for purposes of storage?” you will ﬁnd them.

Increase the Capacity of Existing Storage Space
My favorite examples to illustrate how to achieve “more with less” come
from the California Closet Company (CCC). As ideas from this innovative
ﬁrm have proven, you can double (or triple) your storage capacity without adding even one square inch of new space. Simply reorganize and redesign the raw space that already exists. Although founded as a closet
company, CCC now redesigns garages, ofﬁces, workshops, and kitchens.
Put these same reorganizing principles to work and you’ll really wow
your prospective tenants.You will give your rentals a sought-after beneﬁt.

You could also make some space serve multiple purposes. The most common way to multipurpose is through use of a Murphy bed that folds up
against a wall. A Murphy bed not only adds usable
ﬂoor space, it also opens up the possibility of shelving alongside the bed. You can either use the wall
cavity or create a new, larger cavity by bringing a
new wall out even with the Murphy bed.

Check Noise Levels
No one likes noise. Before you invest, test the units for soundprooﬁng.
Will noise from a television or stereo carry throughout the house or
apartment? When you inspect properties, bring along a portable radio.
Test various rooms. Turn up the volume. Do the walls provide enough
soundprooﬁng? Families and roommate tenants want privacy and quiet.
If your rental property fails to offer quiet, your units will lose appeal.

Check for Neighborhood Noise
Just as important, will your tenants hear neighbors or neighborhood
noise from inside their units? Again, people pay for quiet. They discount
heavily for noise.
No doubt, you’ll typically hear more noise in
neighborhoods ﬁlled with apartment buildings. But

gines. Does the drum corps of the nearby high
school practice outside three hours a day? When
possible, visit the property during periods of high trafﬁc or peak noise.
Don’t assume that a neighborhood offers peace and quiet. Verify.

Ask for Written Disclosures
Seek written disclosures from the seller of the property. Talk with tenants and neighbors. Find out whether anyone has tried to enforce quiet

ing? When you suppress noise, you create value.

Overall Livability
Never think “rental property.” Always remember, you are providing people a home. As you design the overall appeal of a property, imagine how
the units will be for your intended target market of residents.
◆ Do the units offer enough square footage?
◆ Are the units spotlessly clean, fresh, and bright? Do they smell

clean and fresh?
◆ Do the room counts and room sizes represent the most prof-

itable use of space?
◆ Do the aesthetics of the units excite with emotional appeal?
◆ Does the unit bring in enough natural light?
◆ What views will the tenants see from inside the units looking

out?
◆ Do the units offer generous amounts of closets and storage

space?
◆ Are the units quiet?
◆ Will tenants feel safe and secure within the units?
◆ Do the kitchens and baths offer eye-pleasing pizzazz?

Experience proves that homes rent faster and enjoy lower vacancies than mere rental houses and apartments. Give your tenants something special. You’ll earn higher proﬁts. You’ll boost the value of your
properties.

Twenty-One More Ways to Boost
the Value of Your Properties

You’re now well on your way to create instant wealth. Your great livable
units sparkle with pizzazz and emotional appeal. These units will keep
your building full of tenants who will gladly pay premium prices.
Yet, before sharp interiors can woo your prospective tenants, you
must get them to keep their appointments to inspect the homes that you
are offering. Nothing will accomplish this goal better than curb appeal.

You can write an award-winning newspaper ad that

in front of the building and immediately begin to
ask themselves,“What are we doing here? This place
is nothing like I imagined. Do you think we should
go in?”
“Nah, why waste our time? This place is a
dump. We shouldn’t even think about living here.”

Twenty-One More Ways to Boost the Value of Your Properties

Your Building Is Your Best Advertisement
More than likely, hundreds (maybe thousands) of people will pass by
your property each week. What will they notice about the property? Will
it appear as that run-down rental of the neighborhood, a nondescript
plain Jane? Or will it cause passersby to remark,“Isn’t that building kept
up well? Those ﬂower gardens and brick walkways seem to reach out
and invite us to come inside.”
If you want your building to generate more income, create an inviting exterior. Create award-winning publicity with knockout curb appeal.
Not only will an attractive, well-kept exterior appeal to a better class of
tenants, it will also increase tenant satisfaction and reduce turnover. To
create strikingly attractive curb appeal, make these improvements:
1. Clean up the grounds. When you ﬁrst take over a property,
get busy with a meticulous cleanup of the grounds, parking
area, and walkways. Pick up trash, accumulated leaves, and
fallen tree branches. Build a fence to block that view of the
dumpsters. Tell tenants to remove their inoperable cars from
the parking lots, parking spaces, or driveways. If abandoned
cars are parked on the street, ask the city government to post
them and tow them.
2. Yard care and landscaping. Tenants and homebuyers alike
love a manicured lawn, ﬂower-lined walkways, mulched
shrubs, and ﬂower gardens. With landscaping, you can turn an
ordinary building into a showcase property. With landscaping
you can create privacy, manufacture a gorgeous view looking
out from the inside of the units, or eliminate an ugly view. Especially if you’re looking at a holding period of three to ﬁve
years (or longer), put in those small plants, shrubs, ﬂower gardens, and hedges now. When you sell, those mature plantings
will easily earn you a return of at least $10 for each $1 the
landscaping cost you.
3. Sidewalks, walkways, and parking areas. Replace or repair major cracks and buckling that may appear in your sidewalks and parking areas. Remove all grass or weeds growing
through the cracks. Edge all of the areas where the yard abuts
concrete or asphalt. Neatness pays. Overgrown grass and
weeds really stain the curb appeal of a rental property—

202

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

precisely because these types of blemishes signal that the
property is a rental.
4. Fences, lampposts, and mailboxes. For purposes of good
looks, privacy, and security, quality fencing can enhance the
value of a property. Just as certainly, a rusted, rotted, or tumbledown fence blemishes the property; likewise rusty lampposts with broken glass light ﬁxtures. For a nice decorative
touch, add a white picket fence or a low stone fence in the
front of the building. If the building houses a cluster of mailboxes, make sure the mail area is kept neat and the mailbox
lobby or porch area present a good ﬁrst impression.
5. The exterior of the building. Now, turn your attention to
the exterior of the building itself. The building must signal to
prospective tenants that you take good care of your property.
Paint where necessary or desirable. Repair wood rot. Clean
roof and gutters. Next, imagine ways to enhance the building’s appearance with shutters, ﬂower boxes, a dramatic front door and entryway, and new (or

value-creating ideas.
You don’t even have to rely on your own snapshots. Dozens of
“house and home” types of books and magazines ﬁll the shelves of grocers and bookstores. I regularly buy these publications. Their articles
and photos will deﬁnitely enlighten your creative thinking and aesthetic
sensibilities.

Look closely for

extra income.

When you review the income statements of apartment buildings, you will sometimes come across a
line-item entry called “other income.”These amounts
may include money earned from laundry machines, parking, storage
lockers, or various services and amenities.
1. Laundry. Ideally, your rental units will each include space for
washer and dryer hookups. But if they don’t, look for space
somewhere else on the property where you can install coinoperated (actually electronic card-operated) washers and dryers. Without on-premises laundry facilities, your building will
suffer a serious competitive disadvantage. Today, most tenants
have been raised in homes with washers and dryers. These
tenants do not want to cart their washing to a laundromat.
2. Parking. If parking spots are scarce in the neighborhood
where you own properties, consider an extra charge for parking (or perhaps an extra charge for a second car). Do not arbitrarily give one parking space per unit. Some tenants may not
have cars. Others may be willing to park on the street. By pricing your scarce parking separately from the units, those tenants who want it most will pay more.
3. Build storage lockers. Back to the idea of adding storage
space. You create value any time you can squeeze some profitable use out of every nook and cranny within the building,
and within every square foot of the site. One such proﬁtable
use is storage lockers. Does the property include an attic, basement, or crawl space where you could carve out room for
more storage? You can easily rent such lockers for $10 to $20

204

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

per month. Generally, you can achieve payback in less than four
years. If no existing space within the building can serve this
purpose, install several of those prefabricated storage sheds.
4. Add other amenities or services. Whenever you take over
a property, think through a list of services or amenities that
you could provide (preferably at a price) that would increase
your revenue and strengthen your competitive edge. Consider services such as cleaning, day care, or transportation. In
terms of amenities, would your tenants appreciate (and pay
for) a swimming pool, tennis courts, racquetball (or squash)
courts, a ﬁtness center, or a study room? As the widely known
investor, Craig Hall, advises, “Keep an open and searching
mind. Seek out things you can do to attract and satisfy the best
tenants for each speciﬁc investment.” Amen!

Convert a Garage, Attic, or Basement
As you shop for properties, look for those with an
attic, garage, or basement that you can convert to

In contrast, savvy improvers who design and ﬁnish their conversions to wow potential tenants or buyers can and do make serious
money for their efforts. To earn good proﬁts, your space conversion
should achieve the following objectives:
◆ Fit the needs of the target market

ventilation. Follow the same general ideas for attic
and garage conversions. You want these ﬁnished
areas to look, live, feel, and smell as good as the rest of the house. You
want light, height, warmth, and color. You do not want to merely tack up
cheap paneling, hang acoustical tile ceilings, or lay down a roll of indooroutdoor carpeting. Romance the space. Think pizzazz!

Integrate the Conversion into the House

When you evaluate houses for their conversion potential, don’t just think of added living space as an

an integrated addition. A well-planned conversion can easily pay back
two dollars (or more) for every dollar invested.

the city and neighborhood, an accessory apartment
can bring in rents that range anywhere from $250 to
$750 per month. And unless you build from scratch, you can typically
create desirable space for as little as $5,000 and certainly no more than
$15,000.
In other words, viewed in terms of return on investment, $10,000
in renovation costs can often generate a rental income of $4,000 to
$6,000 per year. You can search the world over and never ﬁnd as much
return for so little risk.

Conversions provide boundless opportunities for the creative investor. Converting an old house located in the downtown area can earn

Condominium Conversion
To plan for a condo conversion, study the local area to learn the sales
prices of comparable condo units. If you can purchase a similar apartment building at a low enough price, renovate and sell the converted
units as condos to earn a proﬁt.

rental units into individually owned condominiums for a 16-unit apartment building:

your area, research rental properties, condo prices,
and conversion laws. Do some scratch-pad feasibility calculations. If preliminary estimates look promising, talk with an investor, contractor, attorney, or real estate consultant experienced in the
conversion process. With the knowledge gained from these talks (and
perhaps some follow-up research), you can decide whether this investment approach offers you enough proﬁt potential to offset risks such as
cost overruns, slow sales, and bureaucratic delays.

Convert Apartments or Houses to Ofﬁce Space
Sometimes it’s proﬁtable to convert apartments or houses to ofﬁce
space. To mull over this possibility, answer these questions:
1. Is the property in a commercial zone? If not, can you get the
property rezoned?
2. What is the current vacancy rate for ofﬁce space in the area of
the subject property? If too much space is already available,
can you identify an underserved niche?
3. Do you have adequate parking for ofﬁce space? The city may
require one parking space for every 250–500 square feet of
rentable ofﬁce space.
4. How much will it cost to convert? Could you borrow the
money to ﬁnance such a conversion? And, ﬁnally, will the cost,

Twenty-One More Ways to Boost the Value of Your Properties

209

legal procedures, and time and effort be worth the eventual
proﬁt you will realize?
Study the property and the market carefully. Thoroughly ﬁgure the ﬁnances of the projected conversion. Keep in tune with the requirements. If you can convert at a reasonable cost and earn a good proﬁt,
take a chance. You’ll also gain valuable experience.
(Don’t forget, for more complex investments, partner with someone who is more experienced. Place the promising property under option or purchase contract with contingencies. Then line up your partner
and proceed.)

Cut Operating Expenses
As a rule of thumb, every dollar you slice from your property’s operating
expenses can add $10 or more to your building’s value. With gains like
that, you should meticulously keep track of all expenses.Then make continuous efforts to reduce or eliminate them. Here are some ideas.

Energy Audits
Nearly all utility companies will help you discover ways to reduce your
gas or electric bills. Some will even audit and inspect your property. Others will provide booklets or brochures and, perhaps, a customer service
department to answer specialized questions. You can also ﬁnd dozens of
articles and books at your local library that discuss energy conservation.
Energy-audit a building before you buy it. Then you can judge beforehand the extent to which you can feasibly reduce these costs.

Maintenance and Repair Costs
Savvy investors also need to reduce or eliminate money-wasting property maintenance and repair expenses. From my experience, I would encourage you to focus on ﬁve things:
1. Low-maintenance houses and apartment buildings.
When shopping to buy, favor those properties that are con-

HOW TO INVEST FOR MAXIMUM GAIN

210

5.

structed with materials, HVAC, and ﬁxtures that require less
maintenance. Nothing beats a property that’s built to last with
minimal care. Ditto for yards, shrubs, and landscaping.
Tenant selection. Just as there are both low- and highmaintenance houses and apartment buildings, so too are there
low-maintenance and high-maintenance tenants. Avoid the latter and select the former. Personally, I watch out for chronic
complainers and people who show no “house sense.”
Repair clauses. To further promote tenant responsibility, a
growing number of property owners shift the ﬁrst $50 or
$100 of every repair cost onto their tenants’ shoulders. Also, I
favor high security deposits.
Handyman on call. Nothing eases the drain on your time
and pocketbook as much as having a trustworthy and competent all-around handyman (or persons) to take care of your
property maintenance and repairs.
Preventive maintenance. You inspect and maintain your car.
Do likewise with your investment properties. Anticipate and alleviate when the cost is relatively small. Always ask your maintenance experts how you might replace high-maintenance
items with low-maintenance items.

Property Taxes
“If you think that your property taxes are too high,”writes tax consultant
Harry Koenig,“you’re probably right! Research shows that nearly half of
all properties may be assessed illegally or excessively.” While Koenig
probably overstates the situation somewhat, millions of property owners
do pay more in property taxes than they need to. With just a little attention and planning, you can avoid this trap by taking several precautions:
1. Check the accuracy of your assessed valuation. Usually
tax assessors base their tax calculations on a property’s market value. Look closely at the assessor’s value estimate on your
tax bill. Can you ﬁnd comparable sales of similar properties
that would support a lower value for your property? If so, you
may have grounds to request a tax reduction.
2. Compare your purchase price to the assessor’s estimate of market value. Apart from providing comp sales, if

Twenty-One More Ways to Boost the Value of Your Properties

211

you can show the assessor that you recently paid $190,000 for
a property that the assessor appraised at $240,000, you can
make a good case for lower taxes.
3. Look for unequal treatment. Under the law, assessors must
tax properties in a neighborhood in a fair and uniform manner. You can argue for lower taxes by showing that the assessor has assigned lower values to similar nearby properties.
4. Learn tax assessment laws before you improve or rehabilitate a property. The property tax laws of every state
list the types of property improvements that are taxed and the
applicable millage rates. Once you discover the detailed nature of these laws, develop your property improvement strategy to add value without adding taxes.

Gentriﬁcation and Other Value Plays
In large and midsized cities across the United States and Canada, gentriﬁcation has pushed property prices through the roof in neighborhoods
like Kerrisdale (Vancouver), Buckhead (Atlanta), South of Market (San
Francisco), Chicago North Side, Chicago West Side, College Park (Orlando), “M Street” (Dallas), and Coconut Grove (Miami). Most of these
neighborhoods have become name brands.
In earlier years, though, most of these neighborhoods were modest,
even lower-priced neighborhoods. Several areas such as Chicago Near
North and San Francisco South of Market included
industrial and commercial properties.

hoods still gave residents an easy walk, drive, or
commute to major job districts. And their prices
looked dirt cheap when compared with conveniently situated premier
neighborhoods.
Unfortunately for you, many gentriﬁed name brand neighborhoods no
longer represent good value. That’s not to say that these areas won’t show
strong future appreciation. But that, as a rule, their high prices mean that
your rent collections probably won’t cover your mortgage payments plus
property expenses.

The Good News
But here’s the good news. All across the country, other emerging neighborhoods are poised for turnaround, revitalization, and rapid appreciation of property values. By becoming a neighborhood entrepreneur, you
can score the same large gains that those early investors have earned in
College Park, Near North, and Thorton Park.

Revitalize the Neighborhood
I know that you’ve probably heard it said 100 times: “Buy in the best
neighborhood you can afford. You can change anything about a property
except its location.” At ﬁrst glance, this advice seems plausible. But rethink what the term “neighborhood” actually refers to:
◆ Convenience
◆ Aesthetics
◆ People: attitudes, lifestyles
◆ Legal restrictions
◆ Schools
◆ Taxes/services
◆ Microclimate (weather)
◆ Safety and security
◆ Image/reputation
◆ Affordability

features? List the neighborhood’s weak points. How can you and others

Safety and Security In addition to reducing crime, you can bolster
the safety within the neighborhood (especially for children and seniors)
by slowing down or rerouting trafﬁc. In fact, if you can get the city to lay
down speed bumps, you achieve both objectives at the same time. Speed
bumps not only force motorists to let up on the gas pedal, they tell drivers who want to speed that they’d better travel a different street.
You might also try lower posted speed limits and more intense enforcement. In Berkeley, California, neighborhoods lobbied the city to

says,“You can get anything you want in life, but you
must do more than ask. You must negotiate.”
So, in this chapter, you’re going to see how you can win what you
want through negotiation.

How to Deﬁne Win-Win
You’ve probably heard of the negotiating style called win-win. But do
you really know what that negotiating style implies? Most people
don’t—even though they think they do.

Myth Versus Reality
In the fairy-tale world of win-win, you and the other party to the negotiation sit down together, openly share information about each other,

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

explore options and possibilities, express concerns, focus on goals, and
then come up with a solution that truly satisﬁes both of you. Maybe in
the land of Oz negotiations proceed this smoothly, but not in the real
world.
“Why not?” you ask.
Because in the real world, we all want the best deal we can cut. You
want to pay less. I want you to pay more. I want possession within 30 days; you do not want to give up

deal points for controversy goes on and on.

Forget “What’s Fair”
At least 9 out of every 10 times, the people with whom you negotiate
will try to pull more chips into their own pile and leave you with less.
Likewise (unless you’re sporting a halo), you’ll also want the larger pile.
Maybe this sounds crass, but that’s the way most investors play the negotiating game. Forget “what’s fair” as the deciding arbiter.
To succeed as a wealth-building real estate investor, cast aside your
illusions. To get what you want, you must go well beyond the idealized
view of win-win.

The Real Meaning of Win-Win
Yes, win-win does foster cooperation. It does foster mutual problem
solving. And it does require you to think up more deal points to (as they
say) make the pie bigger.
But let’s face facts. No matter what negotiating style you choose to
get what you want, you will run bluffs, drag red herrings across the other
party’s path, create subtle ways to extract information, and protest that
you cannot pay more even though you know full well that you are willing and able to do so.

style so common to New York lawyers. You do not try to disrespect, belittle, denigrate, or put down the other party. You do not press the other
party against a wall, pick his pockets of everything you can ﬁnd, and
then let him loose just to watch him fall to the ﬂoor.
You choose to avoid this win-lose style of negotiating not because
you’re a nice guy or gal (although you may be) but because you can get
more of what you want by adopting a softer, more conciliating manner.
As Zig Zigler is noted for saying, “You can get anything you want in life, as long as you help the other

to feel like they cut the best deal they could.
Who Feels Most Like a Winner? Imagine that you’re negotiating with
a seller. You’re going back and forth on price. Finally, the seller gives in to
give you almost everything you’re asking for. You’re pleased as punch.
Then, after closing, you learn that the seller was really pressed for
cash. Had he not bluffed you into believing that he would go no lower,
he would have sold for $50,000 less than you agreed to pay.
Now, how do you feel? How would most people feel? Right. Their
sense of victory just melted away.
I have negotiated hundreds of agreements, and I can assure you that
most people value their feelings more than the objective deal points.
Naturally, exceptions occur. But more often than not, you win the most
deal points when you encourage the other party to feel like he or she is
winning the negotiations.
Experience Rules I know of no serious real estate investor who enters a negotiation to strike a “fair” agreement in any objective sense.
Rather, they enter negotiations to extract (almost) as much from the
other party as possible. These investors differ primarily in the way they
try to win these deal points.
◆ Win-lose style. The egocentric dealmaker wants to win while

forcing the other party to admit defeat. These investors want the
other party to know that they’ve been outmaneuvered, outsmarted, and overpowered.
◆ Win-win style. The investor who puts this style to work remains
content to know that he persuaded (not forced) the other party

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

224

to push the chips in his direction. But this negotiator never lets on
that he got the best of the deal. He allows the other side to win
that prize. That ploy stands as the real-world meaning of win-win.

Win-win does not
imply an
objectively fair
agreement.

Which negotiating style works best? Each
method has its advocates and practitioners. Personally, I favor win-win. Not because it’s the nice-guy,
“how to win friends and inﬂuence people” approach. Rather, my experience tells me it’s the best
approach to win what I want. Try it, and I’m sure
you will agree.
Now let’s see what methods, tactics, and gambits you can draw on to win more deal points.

Know Thyself
To get what you want from negotiations, you must ﬁrst know what you
want. As you envision it, does this potential deal ﬁt into your wealthbuilding goals? Does it ﬁt within your frame of time, money, and talents?
If completed, will this deal move you closer to where you want to go?
Many beginning investors jump to buy a property because in some
way it seems like a good deal. But before you rush into something because it seems to look good, ﬁgure out whether the deal will be good for
you. Evaluate the deal in terms of your longer-term personal and ﬁnancial goals.

Know the Property and Neighborhood
Prior to talking with the sellers, learn as much about the property as you
can. Here’s a sampling of the information you should try to discover.
◆ How is the property zoned? Are more proﬁtable uses possible?
◆ How large is the lot? What are its dimensions and boundaries?
◆ When did the property last sell? At what price?
◆ Is there a mortgage on the property? What’s the amount of the

outstanding balance? What interest rate?

Win What You Want through Negotiation

225

◆ What school districts apply to the property?
◆ What employers are located nearby?
◆ What are the neighborhood demographics? Who’s moving in?

Who’s moving out?
◆ What percent of neighborhood residents rent versus own?
◆ What range of rents and property prices apply to the neighbor-

hood?

Every time you ask
the sellers a
question, you may
tip off your
intentions.

You might wonder why you should go to all of
this trouble. Why work to discover this property and
neighborhood information on your own when you
could easily ask the sellers (or their real estate agent)?
But here’s the downside to that approach. You might
alert the sellers to some piece of information that they
could use to strengthen their own negotiating position. You might tip your hand about some hidden
value potential you see in the area or the property.

Know the Sellers
Have the sellers accepted or declined any offers on the property? If so,
what were the terms and price? (Sometimes agents will disclose this information. Sometimes you can learn it from a lender, an appraiser, the
sellers’ neighbors, or even the sellers themselves.) If a previous deal fell
through, ﬁnd out why. Will this past experience inﬂuence the sellers’ negotiating positions with you?

Do the Sellers Face Pressure?
Nearly all real estate books advise you to ﬁnd “motivated” sellers. Who
are these wonderful folks who will gladly give you a good deal? Generally, they’re sellers who face severe pressures of time, money, or family
situation (divorce, death, job move, retirement).
Know the sellers’ personal or ﬁnancial circumstances and you’ll
learn the deal points that they might value most. You’ll also discover
those issues the sellers might be willing to resolve in your favor (bargain
price, owner ﬁnancing, lease option,“subject to” purchase).

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

226

Get the Sellers to Like You
People give better deals to people they like. So try to build rapport with
the sellers. Read a copy of Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends and Inﬂuence People (New York: Pocket Books, 1936,
1990). Don’t insult, argue, contradict, or directly
Sellers give better
challenge anything the sellers say. Always hedge
your differing views with statements such as “Have

ence,”“Oh, it was my understanding that,” and “What
if I were to . . .”
When sellers like you, they will help you get what you want. If they
dislike you, they will favor other buyers—even though the other buyers
are proposing what objectively appears to be a less attractive offer.
Never come at sellers from sharp angles.

Tact, Not Ultimatums
When you’re negotiating with sellers in distress, never use the cliché,
“Take it or leave it.” Apart from proving you to be a tactless amateur, such
a ploy seldom works. In most cases, even property owners under duress
would sooner lose their money than part with their ego and self-esteem.
The same negativity attaches to out-of-the-blue, lowball offers that shoot
out untethered by reason, empathy, and understanding. To work best with a troubled owner, work with,
Don’t conquer,
not against. With these types of sellers (as well as
nearly all others, too), mutual problem-solving outconciliate.
performs one-upmanship. Don’t conquer, conciliate.

Negotiate an Agreement, Not Just Price
In contrast to buying stocks where transactions take place according to
a set price and essentially ﬁxed terms, in real estate almost anything’s negotiable. If the sellers seem inﬂexible on price, look for other valueadded concessions. Or if it is they who require a quick close or sure sale,
oblige their demands in return for requests of your own.
For purposes of bragging rights, some sellers insist on a “high”
price. Okay, give them what they want.Then take back more in favorable

and conditions of value. Remember, in real estate
you can negotiate a winning agreement without directly negotiating a bargain price. As a win-win negotiator, remain alert to white-chip issues and
concerns that you can trade off to win the blue chip
issues that you prize most.

Establish Favorable Benchmarks
Sellers often entertain some strange ideas about why their property warrants a particular price. If you encounter such a situation, don’t argue.
Seek information. Ask the sellers (or their agent) how they arrived at
such a value. Frequently, you will ﬁnd their benchmark either inaccurate
or irrelevant. For example:
1. Add-in costs. “We paid $25,000 for that kitchen remodel,” the
sellers might say.
2. The Joneses’ house. “The Joneses down the street just got
$245,000 for their house, and it’s 400 square feet smaller than
ours,” is a frequently heard rationale.
3. The appraisal. “$185,000 is a great price for this property.
Look, here’s an appraisal. The appraiser says it’s worth
$205,000.”
4. Their past purchase price. “We paid $425,000 a year and a
half ago. At $445,000 you’re getting a steal. Properties in this
neighborhood are going up 10 to 15 percent a year.”

228

long way toward getting them to accept your price (or other terms and
conditions). When you merely try to pull down the seller’s price while
leaving them to hold tightly to their benchmarks, you’ll usually ﬁnd it
tough to break their grip. (For various legitimate benchmarks of value,
see Chapter 12.

Tit for Tat
Never concede without asking for a return concession. “If I can meet
your need on point X, would you be willing to accept Y?” To concede
without a return request invites continued “nibbling.” In addition, agreement without request gives the seller second thoughts. “Why is Mr.
Buyer jumping at this? Am I selling too low?” Do the sellers a favor. For
each concession you give up, ask the sellers for something in return.

Get Seller Concessions Early
In their eagerness to entice your interest, many sellers will begin to concede deal points well before you formally open negotiations. During
your initial casual discussions, test the waters. “Have you thought about
carrying back ﬁnancing? I know you’re asking $415,000, but what kind
of price would you be happy with? Which of the appliances are you willing to leave? How much of the closing costs had you
planned to pay?”

their cards closer to the table.

Come Ready to Buy
Know the sellers. Know the property. Know the neighborhood. Know
the market. Know values. Know your ﬁnances. Know what you’re looking for. Then, when you see it, move, move, move. The “well-let-me-think-

Win What You Want through Negotiation

229

it-over” investor won’t score nearly as many great buys as that investor
who comes into the game ready to play. You can’t expect good buys to
remain unrecognized for long. During the past year, I’ve looked at
around a dozen properties that I considered good-to-great buys. Nearly
all of them sold within four weeks (or less) of hitting the market. Several
sold the ﬁrst day their “For Sale” signs went up.

Ask for More than You Expect
Ideally, you want the sellers to begin sweetening the deal before you
write up your ﬁrst offer. But at some point, you will need to submit a
written purchase contract. When you do, ask for much more than you
could possibly expect to eventually settle for.

Your Goal Is to Make Money
Remember, as an investor, you are doing deals primarily to make money.
Don’t become emotionally attached to an investment property as you
might a house that you intend to occupy as your long-term home. With
an investment, the numbers either work to give you a great buy, or they
don’t. When they don’t, keep on negotiating—or look elsewhere.

suits your personal needs like no other, I would cauGo for more than

offend the sellers. In response, the sellers might either
reject you as a buyer or accept another offer. You
could end up severely disappointed. You missed the home of your dreams.
Not so with an investment property. With an investment property,
alternatives always exist. With investment properties, you’re negotiating
for ﬁnancial reward, not any one property per se.

The Beneﬁts of Asking for More than You Want or Expect
How would you feel if you offered $200,000 and the sellers quickly said,
“We’ll take it. When do you want to close?” Undoubtedly, you would

230

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

soon regret your offer. You tell yourself,“That was a dumb move. I bet
the sellers would have accepted a lot less.”
Likewise, the sellers will begin to question the wisdom of their decision. They begin to think, “If this buyer was willing to open with an
offer of $200,000, he surely would have been willing to go up to
$210,000, maybe even $225,000. We acted too hastily. We should have
countered.”
When you ask for a better deal than you could possibly expect to
get, you actually promote your goals in several ways.
◆ It gives you room to negotiate.
◆ It reduces the sellers’ expectations.
◆ It permits you to make concessions and helps the sellers feel like

they have won.
And last, but far from least,
◆ The sellers may surprise you. They might fulﬁll your wish list

with only minor changes.
In that pleasant situation, you would still want to assure the sellers
that they got nearly all that you were willing to give. Had they not accepted, you would have bought that other fourplex you were looking at.
“In fact,” you tell the sellers,“I now wish I had tried to make that other
deal. I think those sellers were willing to carry back ﬁnancing at 6 percent interest with just 10 percent down.”

Establish Credibility
No one wants to negotiate with a ﬂake. To entice the sellers, let them
know that they can count on you to do what you say. Remember, emphasize your strong points:
◆ Character
◆ Credit
◆ Capacity
◆ Consistency

Win What You Want through Negotiation

231

If your record is weak in any particular area, emphasize whatever compensating factors you can think of.
What evidence might you keep on hand to bolster your ability to
close a deal and perform as promised? To the extent these documents
would help your case, you might set up a ﬁle for seller review (when
necessary) any or all of the following items:
◆ FICO score and credit reports
◆ Past payment records on other real estate (rent or mortgage)
◆ Experience with contractors, rehabs, renovations
◆ Bank statements to prove you have more than enough cash to

close plus substantial reserves
◆ A letter of intent from your partners or a copy of your partner-

ship agreement
◆ Testimonials and references from others who have worked

with you
◆ Prior real estate ownership or management experience

Before you try to sell your offer to the property owners, sell yourself as a
credible, trustworthy investor.

Never Offer to Split the Difference
To bring a perceived deadlock to an end, you may be tempted to blurt
out,“Okay, let’s just split the difference.” Resist this impulse.
You want the sellers to propose this solution. Because once they’ve
put this offer out, they’ve essentially announced that they will accept
this new lower price.
Now you can counter the sellers’“split the difference” offer.“I don’t
know,” you say. “I really can’t go any higher than the
$290,000 ﬁgure that my calculations require. Your
new price of $310,000 won’t give me the return I

at a price of $300,000.”

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

232

The Mental Commitment
Now, you’re within $10,000 and 0.75 percent of agreement. The
sellers have mentally moved their position from $330,000 to
$310,000. It’s almost certain that your deal will end up closing at a
price less than $310,000 and at an interest rate of less than 7.75 percent.
You win the deal points. The sellers—provided you have protested
long and loud enough—feel they won the negotiation. They managed to
extract from you your absolute best offer—or so they believe. Then
when you congratulate and compliment them on their tough bargaining
skills, you put the icing on their cake.

The Price Dilemma
Avoid suggesting a split-the-difference solution for one more reason. It
tends to focus the negotiations on price. When possible, rather than let
price alone create a deadlock or impasse, keep searching through your
total bundle of possible deal points. Keep looking for those high-value,
low-value tradeoffs. What might you or the sellers need or want besides
money?

List Your BATNAs

With other options
in view, you
strengthen your

willpower.

In negotiating lingo, BATNA stands for your best alternative to a negotiated agreement. To negotiate a
winning agreement, you must maintain your walkaway willpower. When you negotiate to buy an investment property, always explicitly list your other
potential choices. Always say to yourself,“If I can’t
get the deal I’m looking for here, what other opportunities can I pursue?”
Remember, you’re not negotiating to buy a
property. You’re negotiating to earn a good proﬁt.

Win What You Want through Negotiation

233

Negotiate for Yourself
Writing in Real Estate Today, a national trade magazine for Realtors,
sales agent Sal Greer tells of an offer he received on one of his listings.
Sal says that after receiving the purchase offer from a buyer’s agent, this
agent told Sal,“This is their [ﬁrst] offer, but I know my buyers will go up
to $150,000.”
“Of course,” Sal adds, “I told my sellers that information, and we
were pleased with the outcome of the transaction.”
The lesson for you is very plain. Never let your agent do your negotiating for you. Don’t give your agent information you do not want the
other side to learn. Do not let on to your agent that you’re willing to pay
a higher price than your ﬁrst offer. Use your agent as a fact ﬁnder and intermediary. But guard your emotions, conﬁdences, and intentions.
Many ﬁrst-time investors mistakenly rely too heavily on their agents
to actually come up with the terms of their offer and carry out their negotiations. These investors will ask their agents,

risks.

You May Be Working with a Subagent
Remember, you may be working with the sellers’ listing agent or a subagent. Often “your” agent’s legal duty is to the seller. In favoring the sellers’ interests, the agent may persuade you to boost the price or terms of
your offer. Or the agent my disclose your conﬁdences to the sellers.
As a practical matter, many sellers’ agents don’t

vestors—even to the detriment of their sellers.

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

234

Nevertheless, because you don’t know for sure how an agent will
use the information you share, carefully limit your disclosures. Likewise,
when it comes to offering price and terms, rely on an agent for facts
about the sellers, selling prices of comparable properties, neighborhood
statistics, and general market conditions. Listen to the agent’s price recommendations and accept the beneﬁts of his or her knowledge and experience. But don’t delegate your decision making. You may be led into
giving up more than you need to.

Be Cautious of Buyers’ Agents
Increasingly, brokerage ﬁrms and sales agents have been promoting buyers’ agency. Because sellers are represented by their listing agents, buyers presumably need someone to look out for their interests. Marilyn
Wilson, a Bellingham,Washington, real estate broker, says,“Buyers should
think of their agents as attorneys. Would you want to have one attorney
representing both parties in a divorce settlement?”

ﬁdences—either intentionally or unintentionally.
Second, we’re all subject to subtle inﬂuences. A
buyers’ agent may talk you into offering a higher price or better terms
because it will make his or her job easier. Under which scenario do you

$410,000, or when you offer $385,000 and say,“If they don’t accept this
offer, there’s four or ﬁve other properties I’d like to look at”?

Watch What You Say
Regardless of whether you’re working with a sellers’ agent, a buyers’
agent, a dual agent, or a facilitator, watch what you say. Don’t tell an
agent everything and then turn the negotiations over to her with the
simple instructions, “Do the best job you can,” or “Why don’t you try
$235,000 and if that doesn’t ﬂy, we can go up to $245,000.”

Negotiating expert Bob Woolf says,“There isn’t any contract I have negotiated where I didn’t feel I could have gone for more money or an additional beneﬁt.” Why leave money on the table? Because skilled
negotiators know,“The deal’s not over til it’s over.” If you push too hard,
you create resentment and hostility in the other party. Even if they’ve
signed a contract, they’ll start thinking of all the ways they can get out of
it. Even worse, if you stumble on the way to closing, they won’t help you
up. They’ll just kick dirt in your face.

How to Write Your
Purchase Offer

Quite likely, when you get ready to make your offer to buy a property,
you’ll be handed a so-called standard purchase agreement to ﬁll out and
sign. But wait. Before you blindly accept that form, read it closely.

No Single Contract Form
No all-purpose form contract has ever been written. Just as important,
the form used in your area may not fully serve you or the sellers’ interests. Although space here doesn’t permit a detailed discussion of every
contract term that you might see, I’ll go over many of those terms that
you should pay special attention to.
Indeed, before you even think about putting in an offer on a property, ask a real estate agent to provide you with a

don’t fully understand.

237

Make Sure You Draft These Clauses with Care and Understanding
Although there’s no such thing as a “standard” purchase offer, the discussion here does explain those clauses that you should make sure you
(your agent, your lawyer) draft with care and understanding.

Names of the Parties
Your agreement should include the names of all parties to the transaction. It is especially important that your agreement name all owners
(sellers) and make sure all are available to sign your offer as soon as you
reach agreement. Be wary of negotiating with a seller whose spouse or
partners do not actively join in the negotiations. If they don’t later agree
to sign, you have no deal.
Some sellers will claim that their co-owners will go along with
whatever they say. Yet, after you commit, the seller will come back and
say,“Gee, I’m terribly sorry. My partner refuses to sign. He thinks I’m giving the property away. He wants another $25,000,
but I’ve told him I can’t renege and change the

ally sorry, but sometimes my partner gets obstinate
and there’s little I can do to reason with him.”
This ploy is one of the oldest tricks in the book. But it often works.
So sellers (and buyers) continue to use it. Just don’t be surprised when
you have it pulled on you—if you’ve proceeded to negotiate with someone who lacks the legal authority to carry out the agreement. (Or some
sellers might say,“Gee, I’m sorry. I know I agreed to these terms, but my
lawyer says ‘no way.’”)

Site Description
Identify the property that you’re buying by street address and legal description. As a safeguard, walk the boundaries of the property as you
follow the lines on a survey or a plot plan. When you walk the boundaries, note any encroachments. Does the neighbors’ garage overlap the

Walk and conﬁrm

Building Description
Often, your real estate agreement needs to identify only the lot, not the
building. That’s because the legal deﬁnition of real estate (the surface of
the Earth) automatically includes all structures permanently attached to
the land.
If the seller, though, has represented to you that the buildings are of
a speciﬁc size or are built of certain materials, or of a certain historic
date or design, then write those features (whatever they are) into the
property description. In Berkeley, California, buyers sued the sellers of a
gracious old home because the sellers had (mistakenly) told the buyers
that the home had been designed by Julia Morgan, a famous San Francisco Bay Area architect of the early 1900s.

critical details. Verify that the building you think you’re buying actually

expectations (the seller’s representations) prove incorrect, you may be
able to rescind the agreement, sue for damages, or both.

How to Write Your Purchase Offer

239

Personal Property
Although the legal deﬁnition of real estate applies to land and buildings, it
does not necessarily include the personal property that the sellers have
promised to leave for you. (Generally, the term personal property refers
to items that are not “permanently”attached to a building or the land.) Say
the sellers of a fourplex provide their tenants window air conditioners,
miniblinds, gas ranges, refrigerators, and ceiling fans. In your written offer
to buy that property, expressly list these additional items.
Courts Have Extended the Deﬁnition of Real Property While it’s

don’t depend on litigation to force the sellers to convey the personal
property that you believed to be included in the sale. Leave no doubt—
write it out. Go through every room of the property. List every item that
the sellers might plausibly maintain was not a part of your agreement because it was their “personal property” and therefore not included with
the sale of the real estate.
Who Owns What? Sellers or Tenants? Listing personal property
serves another purpose as well. It requires the sellers to clearly point out
what personal property belongs to them and what belongs to their tenants. Property investors who do not obtain an accurate list of the seller’s
personal property may later ﬁnd themselves in dispute with tenants
when the tenants claim,“That refrigerator is ours. That junk icebox the
landlord provided was carted off to the dump two years ago. We bought
this refrigerator from Betty’s parents.”
To be safe, ask the sellers’ tenants to okay any list
of personal property that you and the sellers prepare.
Ask the tenants to

owners’ items.

Price and Financing
When you prepare your offer, spell out the precise purchase price and
the terms of the ﬁnancing. List the amounts payable, how payable, when

240

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

payable, and the interest rate(s). Make interpretation easy for a disinterested third party. Leave nothing to decide at some later date. “Seller
agrees to carry back $20,000 on mutually agreeable terms” leaves too
much ambiguity.
When planning to borrow new ﬁnancing, or even if you’re assuming the seller’s mortgage, this same advice holds: Don’t leave the amount
and terms of ﬁnancing open to question. If you need a 5 percent down
loan at 6.0 percent interest, write those terms into your ﬁnancing contingency.

Earnest Money Deposit
Contrary to popular belief, the validity of your purchase offer does not

amount as part of your negotiation strategy.
Size of the Deposit Large deposits signal to the sellers that you are a
serious buyer. Some investors use large deposits to offset their lowball
offers. A large earnest money deposit tells the sellers,“You can count on
me to buy your property. This large deposit proves that I mean what I
say. Wouldn’t you rather go for a sure thing now rather than wait for a
better offer that may never come along?”
On the other hand, a small deposit may signal that you’re ﬁnancially
weak, or that you’re trying to tie up the property cheaply while you mull
over other options. But here’s the rub: Smart sellers won’t accept purchase offers that don’t truly commit you to buying their property.
Learn Local Custom To some degree, whether the sellers think your
deposit large or small, serious or triﬂing, depends on local custom. So
gauge the impression you will make with your deposit by the amounts
local sellers and realty agents think reasonable for the type of property
that you’re buying.
Just keep in mind that a deposit that seems low tarnishes your credibility. A high deposit brightens your credibility. You could employ a low

deposit strategy and rely on other factors to support your credibility as a
buyer (current ownership of multiple properties, strong FICO score,
high net worth, person of integrity). But this trick is difﬁcult to pull off.
As a rule, few things speak louder than ready cash.

Quality of Title

Always rely on
legal counsel or
title insurance for
opinions of title
quality.

Many arcane legalities surround the issue of title
quality. To get good title, you need a real estate attorney or, better, a title insurer. However, your purchase
agreement will state the title guarantees and exceptions that govern your transaction. Make sure you
know what these are before you sign. Especially exercise caution when you buy a property through
foreclosure, tax sale, sheriff’s auction, probate, or
some other type of sale where the previous owner
of the property does not sign the deed.

Property Condition
Your purchase offer should address the issue of property condition in
two ways. First, ask the sellers to complete a property disclosure statement that lists every conceivable problem or defect that now or ever has
affected the property and the neighborhood.
Second, while you can learn a great deal from seller disclosure, you
can’t learn everything. Generally, sellers must disclose only what they
know. As added protection, include a property inspection contingency
in your offer. Then, check out the property with one or more pros who
can verify the condition of the plumbing, heating and air conditioning,
electrical system, rooﬁng, and foundation.
You can write your inspection contingency to set a cost limit on
needed repairs (e.g., $1,000). Ideally, the sellers should pay these costs.
But if you’ve negotiated a bargain price, you might accept responsibility.
If repair costs go over your stated amount, your contingency clause
should give you the right to withdraw your offer and get back your
earnest money deposit.

242

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

Preclosing Property Damage (Casualty Clause)
Your purchase offer should require the sellers to deliver their property
to you on the date of closing (or the date of possession) in the same
condition as it stood on the date the sellers accepted your offer. If the
property suffers damage (ﬁre, earthquake, vandalism, hurricane, ﬂood)
after the purchase contract has been signed, but prior to closing, the sellers must repair the property at their expense. Alternatively, in the event
of damage, you or the sellers may be allowed to pull out of the agreement, and you will get back your deposit.

Closing (Settlement) Costs
Many real estate transactions involve thousands of dollars in closing
costs. You or the sellers might pay for title insurance, an appraisal, mortgage points, buy-down fees, application fees, lender-mandated repairs,
lawyers’ fees, mortgage assumption fees, recording
fees, transfer taxes, document stamps, survey, property inspections, escrow fees, real estate brokerage

low as you’d like, ask them to pay more of the settlement costs.

Closing and Possession Dates
Your offer to buy a property should set dates for settlement and possession. When you or the sellers place great importance on either a quick
(or delayed) closing date, that date can play a valuable role in your negotiations. Because of a need for ready cash, the sellers might trade a lower
price for an early closing date. Or for tax reasons, the sellers may prefer
to delay settlement until after they’ve begun a new tax year.
Likewise for the date of possession. The sellers might want a fast
closing, but they also may want to keep possession of the property (especially if it’s their home) for some period that extends beyond the set-

How to Write Your Purchase Offer

243

tlement date. Maybe their new home isn’t yet completed. Maybe they
would like to postpone moving until after their children ﬁnish the
school term. Their reasons vary, but as a smart negotiator, feel out the
sellers on their preferred closing and possession dates. Then use this information to shape your offer. If you’re willing to meet the sellers’ needs
on this issue, they may meet your requests on price or terms.

Leases
When you buy a rental property, you must abide by the valid leases and
promises that the sellers have entered into with the tenants. Especially
investigate these issues:
◆ Rent levels. How much do the tenants pay in rents? Are any ten-

ants in arrears? Have any tenants prepaid? How long have the
current rent levels been in effect?
◆ Concessions. Did the tenants receive any concession for signing their leases such as one month’s free rent, a new 18-speed bicycle, or any other incentives that lower the effective amount of
rents the tenants are paying?
◆ Utilities. Do the leases require the tenants to pay all of their
own utilities? If not, for what utilities do the owners pay?
◆ Yard care, snow removal, other services. Who provides
yard care, snow removal, or other necessary services such as
small repairs within the rental units? Who pays for garbage and
trash pickup? Do the leases obligate the sellers to provide laundry facilities, off-street parking, a club house, exercise room,
child-care center, or commuter transportation?
◆ Furniture and appliances. Check the leases to determine
whether the owners are required to provide tenants with furniture or appliances. If so, which ones, what quality, and who is responsible for maintenance, repairs, and replacement?
◆ Duration. What term is remaining on each of the leases? Do the
tenants enjoy the option to renew? If renewed, does the lease (or
rent control laws) limit the amount of rent increase that you can
impose?
◆ Security deposits. How much money has the owner collected
from the tenants in security deposits? Have any tenants prepaid
their last month’s rent? Does the seller have an inspection sheet

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

244

that shows the condition of each of the units at the time the tenants moved in? Have the tenants signed those inspection sheets?
◆ Tenant conﬁrmation. Whenever feasible, ask the tenants to
conﬁrm the terms of the lease as the sellers have represented
them. Make sure the sellers (or their property manager) have not
entered into any side agreements with tenants that would modify or override the terms of the lease. Learn whether the sellers
have orally promised any of the tenants special services, rent relief, or other dispensations.
Never forget: Even though you will own the property, the tenants
were there ﬁrst. For the remaining term of their leases, their leasehold
rights may trump your rights of ownership.

Contingency Clauses
Typically, you will hedge your purchase offers with a ﬁnancing contingency and a property inspection contingency. If you can’t get ﬁnancing
on the terms you want, or if the condition of the property doesn’t meet
your standards (as written into your purchase offer), you can call the
deal off. The sellers must return your earnest money to you.
Nevertheless, even though you can condition
your offer on anything you want, that doesn’t mean
“No strings

the sellers will sign it.
On the other hand, a clean “no strings attached”
offer may gain the sellers’ approval even when your price or terms don’t
meet their hopes and expectations. Sellers prefer ﬁrm offers.

Assignment and Inspection
In many states, buyers may freely assign their real estate purchase contracts. However, assume nothing. Talk this issue over with a lawyer. As a

How to Write Your Purchase Offer

245

buyer who (at least on some occasions) may want to “ﬂip” a contract,
make sure that the sellers cannot legally object. As a safeguard, you can
insert an assignment clause into your offer similar to the following:
Buyers may assign this Contract and all rights and obligations
hereunder to any other person, corporation, or trustee.
The sellers may oppose such broad language and try to negotiate language such as:
Buyer may assign this Contract only with the written approval
of the sellers. Consent by the sellers shall not be arbitrarily
withheld.
The sellers may want the right to approve your assignees just to satisfy themselves that the assignees possess the money and credit to complete the purchase. The sellers also may want you to remain liable for
damages (or speciﬁc performance) should your assignees default. Obviously, you would like to avoid (or limit) this liability. If you assign the purchase agreement, you want out of the deal permanently.
When you do obtain the right of assignment, insert a clause that
gives you access. Your potential assignees must be able to inspect and
evaluate the property. Otherwise, only speculators would show any interest in buying the contract from you.

Recording in the Public Records
If you are writing up a lease option, lease purchase, contract-for-deed, or
some other type of purchase offer that delays closing of title for, say,
more than six months, make sure you can record the signed contract in
the public records. This recording serves notice to the world that you
hold rights in that property.
Without this notice, the sellers may place mortgages or other liens
against the property that could jeopardize your legal interests. Also,
without a public record, the sellers’ judgment creditors, or perhaps the
Internal Revenue Service, might stake a priority claim to the property.
You need to discuss these issues with competent legal counsel. You
do not want to make payments to the sellers only to ﬁnd years later that
the sellers cannot deliver good title to you.

246

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

Systems and Appliances
Regardless of whether your closing will take place within 30 days or 3
years, your purchase offer should clearly spell out who is responsible in
the interim for maintenance, repair, and replacement of any malfunctioning systems (heating, air conditioning, electrical, waste disposal, well
water) or appliances. To the extent possible, spell
out how to resolve the “repair or replace” dilemma.
Sellers should

Ideally, you might like your purchase offer to

federal, state, or local environmental laws, rules, or regulations.
Sellers agree to indemnify buyers for all required cleanup
costs that shall be necessary to remedy environmental hazards
(known or unknown) that existed during the sellers’ period of
ownership.
This language only suggests, but it covers two main points: (1) Is
the property free of hazards? and (2) If hazards are discovered, who is
going to pay for the cleanup? Under federal (and many state) laws, as

How to Write Your Purchase Offer

247

owner of a property, you may have to pay for its environmental
cleanup—even when you are innocent of creating the hazard.

Summing Up
Your offer will include many important terms that control the relationship between you and the sellers. Read these terms and conditions before you sign your offer. Then with counsel, add, rewrite, amend, or strike
out terms and conditions as you see ﬁt.
Once you and the sellers sign, you’re both bound to the extent of
the law. To protect yourself, draft your offer so that you understand your
agreement—including what recourses, legal remedies, and costs apply if
you or the other party pulls out of the deal without a legitimate reason.

Craft Your Lease to
Increase Proﬁts

Most small property owners try to use their leases to strictly control tenant behavior. Although imperfect, a written lease does legally protect
your interests—more so than an oral agreement. But your lease can
serve another important purpose: It can help you achieve a competitive
advantage over other property owners.

Achieve Competitive Advantage
Before you decide on the speciﬁc clauses within your lease, closely review the leases of other property owners. Look for ways to differentiate
your rental agreement that would encourage tenants (your target market) to choose your property over competing properties. For example,
to gain competitive advantage, you might
◆ Lower your upfront cash requirements.
◆ Offer a repair guarantee.
◆ Shorten your lease term.
◆ Guarantee a lease renewal without an increase in rent.
◆ Place tenant security and rent deposits in an investment of the

tenant’s choice. Accumulate interest for the tenant’s beneﬁt.
248

Craft Your Lease to Increase Proﬁts

249

Or you might develop a “tight” lease and position your property as
rentals that cater to more discriminating and responsible tenants. You
could include severe lease restrictions on noise and other nuisances
common to other rentals. Then, promote your property as “the quiet
place to live.”When you adapt leases to ﬁt your target market, you can increase your rental revenues, achieve a higher rate of occupancy, and
lower your operating expenses.

Craft Your Rental Agreement
As you think about your lease, look for ways to creatively adapt (or omit)
speciﬁc clauses to better appeal to your tenants. Properly crafted,your lease
will not only protect you legally, but also help you attract topﬂight tenants.

Names and Signatures
Most property owners require a lease to name all residents who are permitted to live in the unit—including children, if any. All adult residents
should sign the lease. As a general rule, investors do not permit tenants
to freely bring in additional tenants or to substitute new co-tenants for
those moving out. Normally, all new tenants are required to fully satisfy
the application and qualiﬁcation process.

Joint and Several Liability
When you rent to co-tenants (even if husband and wife—divorces do
happen), include a “joint and several liability” clause. This clause makes
all tenants individually and collectively responsible for all owed rents
and tenant damages.
Without this clause, individual co-tenants often
claim that they’re liable only for “their part of the
rent.” Or, maybe you’ll hear,“I didn’t burn that hole

Guests
To get around signing up their roommates, some tenants won’t ofﬁcially
bring in new or additional co-tenants. When you show up and wonder who
these new people are, you’ll be told,“They’re guests.”“Joe’s just staying here
for a couple of weeks until he’s called back to work at

limits the number and length of time guests can stay.

Term of Lease
Many landlords reﬂexively set the term of their leases at one year. In
some markets, though, this tendency creates too few properties available
for shorter (or longer) terms. Because short-term (especially seasonal)
tenancies bring in higher rents, you might boost your income by appealing to this potentially underserved market. Another possibility: To reduce turnover and vacancy, give tenants a slight discount if they sign up
for a lease term of, say, two or three years.

Property Description
Precisely describe the property rights you’re giving your tenants. For example, do they receive the right to use the garage, parking spaces, attic,
basement, or outdoor storage shed? Or should you rent those areas at an
additional price? Can you convert any of these spaces to a higher, better,
and more proﬁtable use?

Inventory and Describe Personal Property
If you provide personal property for your tenants (washer, dryer, refrigerator, stove, microwave, blinds, drapes, curtains, furniture), inventory and describe (with photographs or serial numbers where possible) each separate

Craft Your Lease to Increase Proﬁts

251

item and include the list as a lease addendum. Unbelievable as it may sound,
I know of vacating tenants who have taken their landlord’s almost-new appliances and left in their place appliances that ranked just above junk.

Rental Amounts
Some owners set their rent levels low to reduce turnover, vacancy
losses, and tenant complaints. (Complaints fall because tenants don’t
want to give you reason to raise their bargain rent.) Also, slightly belowmarket rents will give you a large pool of applicants from which you can
select topﬂight tenants. Nevertheless, lower rents may not be necessary.
With scarce and desirable features, your units will attract quality tenants
even with rents that sit at the top of the market.

Late Fees and Discounts
To encourage tenants to pay their rent early, some owners offer an “early
payment discount.” Others levy late fees if the tenant’s check comes in,
say, three to ﬁve days past its due date. In recent years, more owners
have adopted the “carrot” approach over the “stick” approach. These
owners claim that discounts create better tenant relations, work more effectively, and are easier to enforce.
Regardless of which method you choose,

time.

Multiple Late Payments
What about the tenant who regularly pays on the eighth or ninth every
month—even though the rent falls due on the ﬁrst? As long as the late
fee is included, some owners tolerate this behavior. I would not. I want
my rents paid on time, every time.
To enforce the “on time, every time” requirement, I either work out
a new payment date with the tenants that better matches their cash
ﬂows or I enforce the “multiple late payment” clause. This clause sets

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

252

forth a “three strikes and you’re out rule.” When tenants won’t pay on
time, kick them out and keep their security deposit (if local law permits). Ditto for repeated bad checks.

Tenant “Improvements”
“If we buy the paint, is it OK for us to paint the living room?” As an
owner of rental properties, you will receive requests like this from tenants. Or you may end up with tenants who don’t ask. They redecorate

permission.

Owner Access
Under the laws of most states, you may not enter your tenants’ home (except for emergencies) without their permission. If you do want access
to make inspections and repairs, take care of damages (like an overﬂowing toilet), show the unit to prospective tenants (or buyers), or for any
other reason, include a reasonable and nonintrusive “owner access”
clause in your leases.

Quiet Enjoyment
Do you want to guarantee your tenants that they will not suffer from noise
and disturbances created by other tenants? Then tightly restrict their
neighbor-disturbing partying, ﬁghting, arguing, and loud lovemaking.
Allow them to play their television, radio, and stereo only at low volumes. You could place a general clause in your lease such as:

Unless you can solve this problem (without spending much money)
your tenants will constantly complain to you.

Noxious Odors
As with noise and disturbances, noxious odors wafting throughout a
building can stir up tenant dissatisfaction and complaints. Leading
sources of noxious odors include smoking, cooking

noxious odors) seem like they could present a probodors drive away

its or excludes the causes of these odors.

Tenant Insurance
Your property owners’ insurance policy will not cover the personal
property of your tenants, so you may want to require them to buy a tenants’ insurance policy. Many
investors have learned through experience that

lawyers) will claim that you should have installed a
better lightning rod.

Sublet and Assignment
When tenants plan to be away from their home for an extended period
(summer in Europe), they may want to sublet their unit. When tenants

254

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

plan to relocate permanently (job change, bought a house), they may
want to assign their lease to someone else. To address this issue, you can
adopt one of these positions:
1. No right to sublet or assign.
2. Right to sublet or assign with owner’s written permission.
Original tenants and new tenants both assume liability for rent
payments and damages.
3. Right to sublet or assign with owner’s written permission.
Original tenants released from any liability for future rent payments or damages. Owner must look exclusively to new tenants for ﬁnancial performance.
4. Unlimited right to sublet or assign. Original tenants remain
liable.
Without a lease restriction, some courts rule that tenants may freely
assign or sublet their units. You don’t want that outcome. So to protect
yourself, include a sublet and assignment clause in your lease.

Pets
Too many property owners prohibit pets. In my experience, responsible
tenants care for their pets in a responsible manner. Irresponsible people
treat their pets irresponsibly. If you select responsible people, you usually can eliminate your “pet problems” without excluding all pets. By accepting responsible people with well-behaved pets, you can boost
proﬁts. Often, you can charge a “pet premium” that requires higher rents
and a higher security deposit.
If you do accept pets, draft a pet rules addendum and attach it to
your lease. Please consider the needs of the pet. I have seen pet rules
that require large dogs to be kept permanently tethered in the back yard on an eight-foot chain. Other

prospects who want to pay their deposit piecemeal over one to three
months. Yield to this request and you invite trouble. (Ditto for postdated
checks.)
Interest Some local and state laws require owners to pay at least some
minimum rate of interest to their tenants. If this law applies in your area,
make sure your tenants know they’ll be receiving interest. In fact, I recommend paying interest to tenants even if the law doesn’t require it.
Today, many tenants get upset if you insist on a deposit (especially a large
one), yet refuse to pass along its earnings to them.
Forfeiture At the time tenants ﬁrst sign their lease, make sure they
understand that their security deposit does not limit their liability for
rent or damages. In addition, clearly explain to the tenants the level of
care (cleanliness, damages) they must meet to get their full security deposit returned to them. Also, explain how you will calculate any
amounts that you might have to subtract from their deposits (or under
what conditions you will try to collect additional money from them.) Security deposits have become a large source of dispute between owners
and tenants.Take special care to explain your deposit policies (and make
sure you always comply with the law).

with interest as soon as you know the correct amount. If possible, the

pay. The tenants accept. You shake hands with them
and wish them well in their new home.

Yard Care
When you rent out a house or duplex, you probably will want the tenants to care for the yard. But don’t just say,“tenants are responsible for
yard care.” I once made this mistake with otherwise excellent tenants.
To these tenants, “yard care” meant cutting the grass. To me it meant
watering the lawn when needed, tending the ﬂowers and shrubs, and
trimming the hedges to maintain them at their existing height of four
feet.
Because the house was located in Florida and I was living in the San
Francisco Bay Area, my visits to the property were not frequent. When
after two years I did return, the hedges had grown wildly to a height of
seven or eight feet, many ﬂowers and shrubs were dead, and the lawn
had scattered brown spots.
Learn from my mistake. If you want your tenants to care for the
yard, spell out exactly what care and condition you want them to
maintain.

Parking, Number, and Type of Vehicles
Some tenants believe that if they can’t ﬁnd parking in a driveway or on
the street, it’s OK to park in the front yard. Or they may persist in blocking their neighbors’ driveways. Or they leave unsightly junk (inoperable) cars to accumulate around

ing clause” in your leases. List the number and
types of permitted vehicles. Then designate the
only places where they may be parked properly. You also may want to
restrict the backyard (or frontyard) mechanic who disassembles his
car and leaves the parts scattered about for days, weeks, or even
months.

Craft Your Lease to Increase Proﬁts

257

Repairs
Increasingly, owners of rental properties are shifting at least some costs
of repair onto their tenants. Stopped-up toilets and broken garbage disposals seldom occur without tenant abuse. As a minimum, you may want
to charge your tenants, say, a $50 repair fee for each time a repair becomes necessary. Some owners even make tenants fully responsible for
certain types of repairs—unless the service provider establishes that the
tenants were not to blame. Overall, your repair policy should encourage
your tenants to care for the property as well as reduce your out-ofpocket costs for unscheduled maintenance and replacement.
Appliances Some owners tell their tenants that they may use the appliances currently in the property, but that the owner will not pay for repairs or replacement if the appliances fail to work right. If the tenants
don’t agree to accept the appliances on those terms, the owner then removes them and the tenants provide and maintain their own appliances.
Which Approach Is Best? As with all lease clauses, no one approach
to repairs works best in all situations. It depends on the types of tenants
and properties you’re dealing with. Undoubtedly,
some people will show little care for your property.

Neat and Clean

Regardless of whether you are renting out houses or
apartments, your lease should set standards of neatness and cleanliness. Proper disposal of trash and
garbage are bare minimums. When tenant neglect

tenant should pay the exterminator—not you.

dishes; disposal of used motor oil, broken furniture,

or appliances; bicycle storage; materials awaiting pickup for recycling;
and vehicles that drip motor oil or transmission ﬂuid.

Rules and Regulations
Especially for apartment buildings—or for rental units in co-ops or condominium projects—prepare a list of rules and regulations that tenants
are expected to follow. Make sure your lease incorporates all of these
rules (usually by addendum). Also, note within your lease that you (or
the homeowners’ association) reserve the right to reasonably amend or
modify the listed rules.

Wear and Tear
So-called standard leases often state that your tenants are responsible for
all damages except normal wear and tear. I would never use such a
clause. It invites tenant neglect and abuse. Many tenants believe that
soiled carpets, cracked plaster, broken screens, and
numerous other damages reﬂect nothing more than

erty, it will not suffer any noticeable wear and tear
during a tenancy of one year or less. For such shortterm periods of residence, tenants should leave the property in the same
condition in which they accepted it. Eliminating the “wear and tear”
clause will save you money and argument.

Lawful Use of Premises
As a matter of good business practice, and as a good-neighbor policy,
your lease should require tenants to abide by all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations. This clause may help you to remedy undesirable
behavior that you didn’t think to put in your lease. Especially enforce a
zero-tolerance rule against illegal drugs or other offenses that can result
in asset forfeiture.

Craft Your Lease to Increase Proﬁts

259

Notice
To help reduce rent loss during turnover, require tenants to give you advance notice of the exact date they plan to move. Then you can begin to
publicize the unit’s upcoming availability. Ideally, you’ll ﬁnd a new tenant who will move in within a day or two after the previous tenants have
moved out.
Most owners require 30 days’ written notice. But if you’re operating in a weak or seasonal rental market, you might ask for 45 or 60 days’
notice. Or if you expect immediate demand for your rental property, you
could reduce your advance notice to, say, 15 days. In other words, tie
your written notice requirement to the length of time you believe necessary to locate a new, strongly qualiﬁed tenant.

Nonwaivers
For reasons of courtesy or practicality, you may, on occasion, permit tenants to temporarily breach a lease clause or house
rule. To prevent tenants from stretching this courDon’t let

right to enforce the letter of the lease tomorrow.

Breach of Lease (or House Rules)
In a breach-of-lease clause, you reinforce your right to terminate the
lease of tenants who breach any lease requirement or house rule. Without this clause, tenants may sometimes believe that if you accept the
rent, you waive your enforcement of other tenant violations. Together,
the nonwaiver and breach-of-lease clauses impress on tenants their obligation to comply 100 percent—or suffer the consequences of eviction.

No Representations (Full Agreement)
On occasion tenants may try to get out of their lease obligations by
claiming you misled them with false promises. They could claim that you

extent of the rental agreement. This clause could
also state that the tenants have not relied on any oral
or written representations or promises that are not explicitly written
into the lease.

Arbitration or Mediation
In many cities, the legal process is too slow, expensive, complex, and
cumbersome to effect timely and affordable justice. As a result, some
property owners write an arbitration (or mediation) clause in their
leases. This clause steers unresolved owner-tenant disputes away from
the courthouse and into a more informal hearing.
Before you adopt such a clause for your leases, investigate how well
arbitration (mediation) works in your area. Learn whether your local
courts show any noticeable bias for or against property owners. Arbitration and mediation tend to work best for investors faced with courts that
generally side with tenants. (Unfortunately, some pro-tenant judges—at
the urging of lawyers who fear a loss of business—refuse to enforce
lease arbitration clauses.)

Attorney Fees (Who Pays?)
“Standard” preprinted leases often include an “attorney fees” clause that
strongly favors property owners. In cases where you prevail in court,
this clause requires losing tenants to pay your “reasonable” attorney and
court costs. In contrast, when your tenants prevail, the clause (through
its silence) leaves attorney fees and costs on the shoulders of each party
who incurred them.
Those courts that still honor the principle that “judges shall not
rewrite lawful contracts” will generally enforce this one-sided attorney
fees clause. These courts reason that any tenant who wanted to modify

wing mindset of “powerful greedy landlords” versus
“powerless victimized tenants.” They see it as their
duty to upset this supposed imbalance of power by placing their thumb
on the scales of justice in favor of tenants.
So, do not place any attorney fees clause in your leases until you explore its practical and legal implications in your locale. Learn from the
experiences of other real estate investors.
Some judges won’t

Written Notice to Remedy
A “written notice to remedy” requires an owner (or tenant) to give written notice prior to taking legal action to enforce a lease provision that
the tenant (or owner) is currently breaching. From your perspective,
written notice can help you in two ways: (1) When you wish to evict a
tenant for cause, previous written notices lay a paper trail that supports
your case; and (2) if in defense of an eviction (or suit for rent) a tenant
falsely claims, “We didn’t have any heat for most of January,” you can
force the tenants to prove that they sent you written notice of this problem. Because their claim lacks truth, their defense fails.

Landlording: Pros and Cons
From the preceding collection of lease clauses, you might say,“Forget it!
Landlording involves too many potential headaches and risks.” But imagine reading a list of laws, regulations, accidents, breakdowns, repairs, lawsuits, hassles, and expenses that you face when driving a car. By focusing
only on the risks of driving, you might put your car in a garage and leave
it there permanently.

The 12 Secrets of
Successful Landlording

You’ve undoubtedly heard the horror stories about managing rental
properties. According to popular lore—mostly propagated by people
who have never owned properties—managing rentals will require you
to answer 2:00 A.M. phone calls from irate tenants, ﬁx leaky plumbing on
Saturday mornings, and chase after deadbeats.
You may have even seen the movie Paciﬁc Heights. In that rentalproperty horror ﬁlm, Michael Keaton plays a demented tenant who viciously torments his landlords (a naive young couple played by Melanie
Grifﬁth and Matthew Modine). In the end, the couple triumphs, but
Keaton’s character puts them through so much grief that they begin to
question their own sanity (see Box 18.1).

The Good News
The good news is that neither popular lore nor Paciﬁc Heights paints an
accurate picture of landlording—which I prefer to redeﬁne as “providing
homes for good people.” Think of any commonplace activity from jogging to taking a ﬂight on an airline. At times, bad things do happen. But
the beneﬁts far outweigh the risks. The same is true of landlording.

They failed to obtain a prepurchase property inspection.
They failed to reasonably anticipate repair and renovation expenses.
They stretched so far to buy that they exhausted all of their
cash and credit.
They believed their tenant’s ﬁsh story.
They permitted their tenant to bring in an unapproved “guest.”
They failed to get the cash before their tenant took possession
of their rental unit.
They did not understand San Francisco’s onerous tenants’
rights laws.
They relied on the legal system to promote justice.
They failed to immediately consult a lawyer when their legal
situation went awry.
They used (illegal) self-help tactics to encourage the tenant to
move.

The good news: Did these beginning investors do anything
right? Absolutely—they bought real estate. Had they continued to
own that Paciﬁc Heights property, they could sell it today for a price
$2 million higher than what they paid for it in 1991 (when the
movie was ﬁlmed).

without worry.

Yet even if the horror stories did reﬂect everyday experience, the great wealth-building power of
properties would more than compensate you for
the aggravation.
Fortunately, owning rentals need not cause you
hassles and headaches. To gain the beneﬁts of property ownership without work and worry, you can either hire a property manager or develop a ﬁrst-class
system of self-management.

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

265

Hired Management versus Self-Management
More than likely, you think the task of property management includes
cleaning the rental unit, advertising vacancies, showing vacancies to
prospects, collecting rents, handling yard work, making repairs, and numerous other chores.
While it’s true that someone does need to keep the routine rental
operations running smoothly, that someone does not need to be you.

Employ a Caretaker or Property Management Company
You can delegate to either a caretaker or a property management company whatever duties you choose to avoid. As a true manager you’re responsible for supervising the work of others, not doing everything
yourself. As the leadership consultant, Phil Van Hooser, says,“A good manager is not someone who can do the work of 10 people. It’s someone
who can get 10 people to work.”
The best owner-manager is the person who

activities, I prefer to work with caretakers.
What Is a Caretaker? A property caretaker looks after as many details of a rental property’s operations as you wish to delegate. My caretakers have done everything from renting apartments to supervising
tradespeople to dealing with routine maintenance.
Yet, even though my caretakers typically look after details, I handle
market strategy, major improvements, and all policies and procedures. In
other words, I manage my properties, but rarely get involved in the dayto-day issues.
Over the years, I have found two types of caretakers work best:
A qualiﬁed tenant. A well-qualiﬁed tenant who knows basic property maintenance and can deal effectively with people makes a
good caretaker. Generally, I provide my caretakers free (or
partial) rent plus an hourly fee for special jobs (repairs, improvements) that fall outside their normal scope of their responsibilities. (No ﬁrm rules apply here because I vary the
responsibilities according to the competencies and time commitment of each speciﬁc caretaker that I have hired.)

266

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

A jack-of-all-trades. Another type of caretaker that I prefer is the
retired or semiretired jack-of-all-trades. In my experience, older
people tend to show a strong work ethic and good sense of personal responsibility. They also tend to know more about how to
remedy speciﬁc repair problems.
Again, the scope of our work agreement determines the amount of
base pay. On average, I’ve found that $12 to $16 an hour will get me a good
person for the job. You might pay more or less. If you choose the caretaker
approach to handling everyday operations,you’ll just have to test the waters.
(I might add that I have never advertised for “help wanted.”To ﬁnd
good candidates, I depend on referrals and informal job discussions, not
formal applications for employment.)
Property Management Companies If you want to passively own
your investments, you can hire a property management company. Typically, these companies manage hundreds of rental units for dozens of different property owners and offer four beneﬁts:
◆ They talk with hundreds of tenants each month and (if they

choose to) can develop excellent knowledge of the rental property market.
◆ Because of their broad experience, they may have developed
well-tested policies and procedures that cover everything from
repairs to tenant selection to rent collection to fair housing compliance.
◆ They may be the ﬁrst to know when one of their clients plans to
sell a property and can give you heads-up notice.
◆ By managing all rental activities, your management company can
minimize the time and effort you devote to your properties.
For some passive investors, property management ﬁrms offer a
needed and desired service. However, using these services also may impose two severe drawbacks:
◆ No company that manages multiple rental units for multiple

owners will design a truly optimal rental strategy for your property. Property management ﬁrms develop policies and procedures to advance their own proﬁts and economies of scale. Your
investments won’t receive special treatment.

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

267

◆ As a rule, property management ﬁrms not only charge a monthly

fee (6 to 10 percent of all rent collections), but may also assess
extra fees for tasks such as renting a vacant apartment (one-half
month’s rent, for example), carrying out an eviction, and contracting for repairs or improvements. In total, these costs can
easily turn a property with positive cash ﬂow into a cash drain.
Investors who rely on property management ﬁrms seldom come
close to maximizing their proﬁts. They can, though, take life easy.

Self-Management
As a beginning investor, I encourage you to actually self-manage your
properties. When you build up your portfolio of rentals, you can then
gradually turn over more and more of the day-to-day activities. Overall,
self-management offers you these advantages:
◆ You will save money. You will eliminate the costs that you

would otherwise pay to a management company, and by selfcontracting your own repair work (or by doing it yourself) you
will spend less.
◆ Your vacant units will rent faster. Whenever I see a longterm vacancy, 80 percent of the time that property is being “professionally” managed. Management ﬁrms seldom work diligently
to ﬁll vacancies. They’re content to put up a sign, maybe run an
ad, and merely wait for a rental prospect to show up. (As you will
soon see, you can do much better than that.)
◆ You will learn ﬁrsthand how to manage a property. This
knowledge will serve you well even if at some point you choose
to delegate some or all of this work. Although I do not now get
involved in the day-to-day work of property operations, the
knowledge and experience I gained from my early do-it-myself
years is still paying off. If you’ve never done it yourself, how will
you be able to design (or critique) the rental policies and procedures of your property manager?
◆ You will learn about the market. When you personally talk
with prospective renters, look at competing properties, and
monitor vacancies and rent levels, you will build a valuable base
of market information. With that market knowledge, you can

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

268

choose the most proﬁtable target market of tenants and then
adapt your property, leases, and rental rates to display a competitive advantage.
For beginning investors, the beneﬁts of self-management stand so
far above your alternatives that even Robert Griswald, author of Property Management for Dummies (and owner of a large property management ﬁrm), advises,
If you have the right traits for managing property, and if you
have the time and live in the vicinity of your property(ies),
you should deﬁnitely do it yourself. (New York: John Wiley &
Sons, 2002, p. 14)

adopt, you can still proﬁt by learning the 12 secrets of successful landlording (see Box 18.2).

Before You Buy, Verify, Verify, Verify
Good management begins before you actually close on your ﬁrst investment. You want to make sure you fully understand the nature of the
beast you are buying. You want no voracious alligators that will chew up
your available cash and credit within the ﬁrst few months of ownership.
At a minimum your prepurchase due diligence should include:

Property Inspection
Obtain a professional report on the condition of the property as well as
reliable cost estimates for repairs and improvements.

People Inspection
Talk with the property owner’s current (and past, if possible) tenants,
neighbors, contractors, repair people, and suppliers. Search for inside information that might signal potential problems (e.g., neighborhood
noise or crime, tenant dissatisfaction, persistent trouble with plumbing,
wiring, or roof leaks).

List of Personal Property
Many property sales include some appliances, window coverings, storage sheds, and other personal property. Secure an itemized list of these
items. Verify the list with current tenants.

Tenant Rent Roll and Files
You want the names, telephone numbers, and leases for all residents of
the property.

Verify Security Deposits
At closing, the seller should turn over all security deposits to you. Make
sure you receive an accurate accounting. Verify the amounts with

270

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

tenants. Remember, you are the person who will return these deposits
when the tenants move out.

Licenses, Permits, Zoning, Building Regulations, Occupancy Codes
Because all kinds of laws apply to rental properties, ﬁnd out whether the
property currently complies with these laws (or, if not, what you will
need to do to bring it into compliance).

Copies of Warranties and Service Contracts
If the roof, water heaters, appliances, HVAC, or other components of the
property are guaranteed in some way, get copies of the warranties or service agreements (e.g., pest control and damage repair). Notify the service providers and pay transfer fees.

Arrange for Insurance Coverage
In some areas of the country, property insurance rates have shot up and
some coverages have become more difﬁcult to obtain (e.g., mold, hurricane, earthquake). Before you commit to closing, go over rates and coverages in detail with an experienced insurance pro (not an ofﬁce clerk).

Prepare the Property for Rental
If tenants now live in the property you’re buying, you will need to comply with their existing rental agreements until the terms of their leases
end. Nevertheless, to plan for imminent vacancies (and perhaps a market
repositioning of the property), you will need to get the property ready in
the following ways:

Choose a Segment of Tenants
Remember, generic properties attract average tenants who pay so-called
market rents. Targeted properties attract topﬂight tenants and yield more

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

271

proﬁts (that result from some combination of higher rents, lower operating expenses, lower turnover, and quicker rent up). So survey the market
and decide the segment of tenants (Section 8, college students, seniors,
families, young professionals, empty nesters, other) you wish to appeal to.
You are free to develop a market strategy, but you can’t turn away
any member of a protected class for reasons related to any protected
characteristics such as race, religion, ethnicity, children, and so forth.

Clean and Paint
Regardless of which market segment you plan to appeal to, clean, paint,
and sharpen the appearance of the property. Both the interior and exterior of the property should appear well kept and attractive. Never try to rent out a unit that fails the

those tenants to whom no sane owner would wish
to rent.

Everything Must Work
Verify that the appliances, electrical outlets, and HVAC operate as they
should. All windows should open and close easily. Repair or replace broken locks, doors, windows, and screens. Remedy any condition of the
property that signals a state of disrepair.

Craft a Winning Value Proposition
When tenants compare your rental unit to the units offered by other
property owners, they don’t just look at its cleanliness and state of repair. They also look for a variety of other items that can lift a property
above its competitors. They want a property that offers them the best
total value proposition. For example, your tenants might prefer any of
the following:

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

272

Owner Demeanor
Do you (or your rental agent) come across as a pleasant person? To
achieve this demeanor, play down the authoritarian “do’s and don’ts.”
Play up your “please the customer” attitude.

Pets, Furniture, Appliances
Can you better appeal to your target market if you accept pets or provide the units with furnishings, furniture, window blinds, or appliances?

Hot-Button Features
What desirable features can you provide that other properties typically
lack? Views, storage, parking, study area, open ﬂoor plan, roommatefriendly ﬂoor plan, soundproof walls, great kitchens and bathrooms?
Learn your tenants’ hot buttons. Then offer those beneﬁts that will wow
your prospects.

Lease Terms and Conditions
Can you craft your lease to suit tenant preferences (while still offering
you legal protection against defaults)? What lease period will seem most
attractive—weekly, month-to-month, annual, longer? How will you handle repairs?

Security Deposits
Many cash-strapped tenants would prefer lower deposits. Can you ﬁgure
out a way to reduce the security deposit without increasing your risks
(cosignor, lien against tenant’s car, phased payment, automatic transfer of
funds)? On the other hand, some tenants are quite willing to pay a high
security deposit in exchange for a top-quality property and perhaps a favorably priced unit.

Rental Rate
Learn the features, lease terms, and rent levels of competing properties. Learn tenant likes and dislikes. Then design and price your units
to give your target market their best value—yet still provide you a
good proﬁt.

Attract Topﬂight Tenants
This principle of superior management requires you to perform two
tasks. First, market the property effectively, and second, strictly screen
your rental applicants.

Get the Word Out
Most owners seldom think beyond hanging out a “for rent” sign and running a classiﬁed ad. Savvy landlords try to think of inexpensive ways to
quickly and directly reach their target audience. These techniques might
include networking, referrals from current or past tenants, info ﬂyers,
brochures, bird dogs, employer bulletin boards,
newsletters, or a college housing ofﬁce.
First, ask yourself, where do the types of tenReduce ad costs

great homes for rent will be easy.

What to Say
Your sales message should go way beyond the commonplace listing of
basic features. It should include a beneﬁt headline followed by the hotbutton features that will pique the attention, desire, and action of your
target market (see Box 18.3).

Property manager and author, Robert Griswald, tells about one of the
lessons he learned about marketing rentals:
I once had a rental property located near a major university. The
property had several vacancies in the 2-bedroom/1-bath units. Because I was wary of renting to large numbers of undergraduate students, my marketing plan was to attract university faculty or graduate
students who I thought would have a roommate and be perfect for
the 2-bedroom unit. Although many prospective tenants looked at the
units, our actual rentals were very slow and our 2-bedroom vacancies
remained unacceptable. Clearly, I was trying to deﬁne and force the
rental market and prospective renters to adapt to my perception of
their needs.
When it became obvious that my rental efforts were not having much success, I began to carefully review the comments of
prospective tenants and actually listen to their needs. What I found
was that there was a strong market for faculty and graduate students, but that they preferred to live alone. The WIFM (what’s in it
for me) from the perspective of the targeted faculty and graduate
students was the desire for a quiet place to work or study without
roommates. With this new perspective on the needs of our prospective tenants,I quickly realized that I could market these very same
2-bedroom/1-bath units to this new target market.
Armed with this knowledge, I revised my marketing efforts
and changed my advertising in the college newspaper to read,“1
bedroom plus den.”This change led to an increased interest in the
property as well as a greater occupancy percentage. Just by changing the way the units were advertised, I found that I was able to
reach my original target market of faculty and graduate students
who wanted to live off campus.
Remember: Look at your rental property from the perspective of the most likely tenants. Then promote and accentuate the
features of your rental property that will be of greatest interest to
the market.

Box 18.3

Focus Your Ad on the Beneﬁts Your Tenants Want

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

275

Don’t Show the Property, Sell It
Do not assume that your prospective tenants will immediately recognize
all of the competitive advantages your property offers. Just as with your
printed sales message, your conversations with tenants should emphasize features and beneﬁts. Explain why your units (and your lease) offer
prospects their best value.

Thoroughly Screen All Tenants
Before any tenant moves into one of your units, verify that person’s
credit score, credit record, rental history, current and past employment,
current and past residences, and personal photo identiﬁcation. To get
credit information, you can either ask the prospective tenants to run
their own report at myﬁco.com and provide a copy to you, or you can
subscribe to this service as provided by a local credit bureau. You can
obtain the other necessary data from the rental application form.

Payment of Rent and Security Deposit
Never permit anyone to move into your units without allowing enough
time for their rent and security deposit checks to clear. If you can’t get
the checks cleared prior to move-in, ask the tenants to pay you with a
cashier’s check drawn on a local bank.

Never Accept Fish Stories
As a property owner, you may hear your share of ﬁsh stories as to why
the tenant cannot comply with your request for background information
and veriﬁed payment of funds. Nine times out of ten, you want that ﬁshy
tenant to get away. (Review Box 18.1. In the Paciﬁc Heights movie,
Michael Keaton always reeled off some ﬁsh story as to why he could
not—or did not—comply with the landlord’s request for references or payment.)
Let your ﬁshy

with excuses that beg forbearance. If you do, I

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

276

guarantee that those initial excuses won’t be the last ones you hear from
that tenant.

Learn and Comply with All Fair Housing Laws
As an owner of rental properties, your advertising and tenant selection
process is governed by federal, state, and local law. To learn these rules
and regulations, stop by your community’s fair housing agency. Talk with
the staff and pick up their brochures. Also, learn how the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) might govern your rental policies and property features (companion animal, parking, entryway access, etc.).

Maintain a Waiting List
If you strategically manage your properties, you will never want for tenants. Your advertising or word-of-mouth referrals will turn up more willing prospects than you can handle at any one time. Keep these surplus
prospects on your radar screen. Create and maintain a waiting list. With
an active waiting list, your vacancies will fall to nearly zero.

Create a Flawless Move-In
Aim your move-in policies and procedures toward satisfying these goals:
◆ Establish cordial relations that will smooth the tension that fre-

quently characterizes a landlord-tenant relationship.
◆ Make sure you and your tenants see eye to eye on all rules that

will govern tenant conduct, property upkeep, and unit occupancy (e.g., parking, guests, alterations, cleanliness, tenant insurance, pets, names and number of residents).
◆ Put the property in make-ready condition.

Cordial Relations
As noted, your property make-ready should conﬁrm the cleanliness of
the unit as well as the working condition of all operable components of

the unit. Make sure the tenants will enjoy their
move-in week without need of complaint. As a special touch, give your new tenants a welcome basket
of ﬂowers, fruits, beverages, and snacks. If the tenants are new to the neighborhood, provide them a
map and a list of nearby shops, stores, schools, services, and restaurants.

Rules and Regulations
Do not simply hand a list of house rules to your tenants. Go through
each item. Explain why you believe the rule is important and how it contributes to tenant welfare, property appearance, or upkeep. Ask the tenant to sign a copy of the rules and put it in your ﬁles with the lease,
rental application, and background reports.
Remind the tenant in a friendly way that the rental agreement incorporates the rules. A breach of the rules means a breach of the lease
and thus triggers whatever remedies your lease provides.

Verify Move-in Condition
At the time your tenants move into the property, walk through with them.
If you have performed your make-ready, you should ﬁnd no broken windows, soiled carpets, or dirty appliances. Nevertheless, if you do ﬁnd any
damages that remain unrepaired, note them on your
move-in checklist. Once the tenants are satisﬁed that

worth more than a thousand words.

Retain Topﬂight Residents
Now that you’ve ﬁlled your rental units with good tenants, what can you
do to retain them as long as possible? Fortunately, you can achieve that
goal pretty easily.

278

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

Keep Tenants Informed
Don’t let tenants come home to ﬁnd a backhoe noisily digging up the
parking lot or a pest control man spraying in their apartment. Notify and
explain to tenants when anything out of the ordinary is about to happen
on or within the property. Tenants don’t like it when you thoughtlessly
disrupt their lives or invade their privacy.

Develop a Plan of Preventive Maintenance
Emergency repairs not only cost you big dollars, they upset residents. No
tenant likes a furnace that won’t throw out heat, a roof that leaks, or a
sink that won’t quickly drain. You can eliminate
most of these types of problems by executing a proAnticipate and
gram of preventive maintenance. Don’t wait for

least minimize the probabilities).

Expect the Unexpected
Even the best preventive maintenance programs won’t prevent every appliance malfunction or HVAC breakdown. So set up a procedure for dealing with these types of problems before they occur.
Make arrangements with reliable and trustworthy service providers.
Give their telephone numbers to your tenants with instructions of when
and under what conditions they should call.
For ordinary, non-emergency repairs, give your tenants a telephone
number that’s hooked up to your voice message machine. When necessary, ask your tenants to call and state their problem. Then acknowledge
their request within 24 hours. If warranted, repair within 72 hours (less
is even better). Nonresponsive landlords rank as one of the top three
tenant complaints. Make repairs courteously and quickly and your tenants will sing your praises to their friends (and your future residents).

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

279

Enforce House Rules Strictly and Fairly
Topﬂight residents want you to enforce house rules consistently and
without favor (or prejudice) among all tenants. Don’t let those few bad
apples spoil the entire barrel. Whether the rules pertain to parking,
noise, unauthorized residents (long-term “guests”), or mishandling of
trash and garbage, you must not let violators go unnoticed (and unpunished).
If you do, you will soon ﬁnd that your good residents will move out
and you will only be able to replace them with lower-quality residents.
Draft rules for the beneﬁt of all. Then enforce them against everyone
equally.

When the Market Supports It, Raise Rents
Since I’ve already gone over the topic of rent collections and late fees in
Chapter 17, I won’t repeat that discussion here. However, there’s still the
topic of how you should handle rent increases.
Whenever you raise rents, you run the risk of losing a good tenant.
Nevertheless, low rents depress your cash ﬂows and diminish the value
of your property. When you know the market will support higher rents
(i.e., when you know topﬂight tenants are willing to pay you more than
you’re currently charging), go for it. Raise the rents.

Verify Market Support
Remember, I said initiate a rent increase if the market will support it.
Some owners try to increase their rents even when the rental market
softens and numerous large-scale complexes are offering move-in concessions such as two months’ free rent or an all-expense-paid trip to
Hawaii. In the face of strong competition, unjustiﬁable attempts to increase rents merely prolong vacancy periods, promote unit turnover, and
invite tenant complaints.

280

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

Soften the Blow with Communication
When you do raise rents, provide evidence to justify the increases. Give
your tenants the results of your market survey of competing properties.
Let them know you’ve registered 16 names on your waiting list. Show
them how your property taxes, property insurance, and maintenance expenses climbed 12 percent this past year.
When possible, phase in your rent increases frequently and gradually. A 10 percent increase all at one time will chase out more tenants
than, say, a 4 percent increase levied each 6 months over a period of 18
months.

Do Something in Return
You can also dampen tenant grumbling and nonrenewals if you do
something for them in return for that rent increase. How about adding
covered parking, installing new carpets or appliances, installing ceiling
fans, or putting in a new security system? Naturally, you don’t want to
wipe out the money you will gain from the rent increase. But you will
create better tenant relations if you at least enhance the desirability of
the property in some way the tenants will appreciate.

Anticipate and Prepare for Special Problems
On rare occasions, even the best selected residents may run into difﬁculty. Divorce, accident, ill health, unemployment, and bankruptcy represent several of the more common problems that tenants may encounter.
If any of these setbacks affect your tenants’ ability to pay their rent, what
do you do?

Show Understanding and Forbearance? Be Careful
In my early years as a landlord, I was a soft touch for sob stories—real
and ﬁctional. Several times, with previously good-paying tenants, I offered forbearance. In every case, the tenants eventually moved out and
never paid the money they owed me.

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

281

That’s why my experience warns me to collect the rent every time,
on time. Otherwise, you should request (or legally compel) the tenants
to move. If your tenants need ﬁnancial assistance, refer them to a charity
or social services agency. Forbearance seldom pays off with a win-win
solution.
(This same advice holds for tenants who persistently break the
rules. If the rule is wrong, change it. If it serves a valid purpose, enforce
it. Forbearance forecasts regret.)

Negotiate a Voluntary Move-Out
When your problem tenant pleads or threatens, but doesn’t move out,
you might try to negotiate a voluntary settlement rather than get involved with the costly, frustrating, and often ineffective court system.
To entice the tenants to leave, you’ll generally have to forgive some
of the monies they owe you. In some instances (although I never have
done this), owners will even agree to pay the tenant to move. No doubt,
in some circumstances, it’s better to get rid of a tenant and accept a
small loss than to drag out a bitter conﬂict and possibly lose thousands
in rent collections and attorney fees.

If You Must Evict, Do It Lawfully
States and cities set the legal procedure that property owners must follow to terminate a lease and evict a tenant. This procedure normally covers (1) lawful grounds, (2) written notice, (3) time to cure or remedy the
breach, (4) the time period before a hearing (or trial), (5) allowable tenant defenses, and (6) the number of days the tenants have to move after
the judge issues the order to kick them out.
Learn this legal procedure as it applies in your area. Then follow it
precisely. Failure to dot all of your i’s and cross all of your t’s can get your
case thrown out. You must then go back and start
the process again. Never threaten or assault a tenNever use illegal

can expose you to numerous types of personal injury lawsuits and criminal charges.

282

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

Maintain the Property
Let me repeat: To attract and retain topﬂight tenants, minimize complaints, and enhance the value of your property, carefully maintain your
grounds and your buildings. In addition to preventive and corrective
maintenance and repairs, you will schedule three other types of maintenance programs:
◆ Custodial maintenance. Assign someone the tasks of yard

care, picking up litter, and washing windows. Keep your property neat and clean.
◆ Cosmetic maintenance. Periodically inspect the grounds, common areas, and rental units to freshen up their cosmetic appearance. Don’t ignore peeling paint, carpet stains, countertop
burns, and other types of wear and tear. Without consistent care,
a property will soon appear run-down.
◆ Safety and security. Always keep your eyes open to spot problems of safety or security. Quickly repair broken stairs, lighting,
locks, window latches, or doors. Make sure all smoke alarms
work. Ask your tenants to call you immediately should they discover any potential threats to safety or security.

Process Move-Outs Smoothly
Alas, all good things must end. At some point, you will see your tenants
move on. When that time comes, make sure that your move-out process
includes the following steps.

Require Written Notice
Your lease should require your tenants to give you formal, written notice
(typically 30 days, more or less) of their speciﬁc move-out date. This notice will give you time to get the word out to topﬂight prospects that the
area’s best landlord (you!) will soon have a unit available for some lucky
tenant. Early notice will also give you time to line up and schedule contractors or tradespeople to make improvements and repairs to the unit.

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

283

Schedule a Final Walkthrough
Do not under any circumstances postpone your damage inspection of
the unit until after the tenant has moved away. Always schedule a ﬁnal
walkthrough of the unit on the same day your tenants are loading up
their moving van. Compare the unit’s condition to your move-in checklist, photos, or video.
At that time, make every effort to settle any
damage claims that you think the tenant should pay.

time they’ve lived in your building, you usually can

tenants move out.
Owners who run into move-out problems generally have made one or more of these errors:
◆ They have failed to maintain the property and try to stick the

tenant with costs that were properly the obligation of the
owner.
◆ They have not monitored the condition of the unit throughout
the tenancy, and then during the ﬁnal walk-through, allege all
kinds of expensive damages.
◆ They try to charge tenants far more for cleaning or repairs than
the owners will actually have to pay to correct the problem.
With infrequent exception, I have found that when I treat my tenants with respect and consideration throughout their tenancy, when I
document their damages, and when I don’t try to overcharge them, they
readily honor their responsibility to cover the reasonable costs of repair.

Persistently Find Ways to Increase Your Cash Flow
Do you know the word kaizen? Tony Robbins popularized this Japanese
term, signifying “continuous improvement.” It means that you should
persistently search for ways to improve. Few of us ever perform at the
top of our game. Much of the time we get lazy. We turn off our creative
impulses. We fail to see obvious opportunities. We achieve much less
than we’re capable of achieving.

ONWARD AND UPWARD TO BUILDING WEALTH

284

Remember the Value Formula
Remember, every net $1,000 you add to your annual rent collections
boosts the value of your property by at least $10,000 to $12,000. Every
net $1,000 you eliminate from your operating expenses boosts the value
of your property by $10,000 to $12,000.

market strategies and management policies.

Regularly Reﬁnance Your Properties
Because (in the early years of property ownership) mortgage interest
costs eat up more of your rent collections than any other expense, stay
in touch with several savvy mortgage brokers. Tell them about the costs
and terms of your current ﬁnancing. Tell them how long you plan to
own the property.
Then ask these loan reps to notify you whenever a reﬁnance might
make you money. Slice your mortgage payments by, say, $500 a month
and you add $6,000 a year to your cash ﬂows.

Keep Trading Up
In his classic book, How I Turned $1,000 into a Million in Real Estate
in My Spare Time (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1958),William Nick-

The 12 Secrets of Successful Landlording

285

erson ﬁrst bought a $10,000 property. After creating value with that
property, Nickerson then traded up to a $40,000 property. He repeated
his process of creating value and next traded up to a $150,000 multiunit
apartment complex. After just 16 years, through the continuous process
of creating value and trading up, Nickerson owned millions of dollars in
properties.
Although today’s prices in most areas of the country dwarf those of
Nickerson’s day, the technique of creating value and trading up still
works. I’ve used it. Most of the professional investors I know have used
it. Likewise, you can use it.
Creating value and trading up offers you the safest and surest path
to building wealth in real estate. If you get started now, experience
proves that within 16 years (or less) you, too, will enjoy a multimilliondollar net worth. I wish you good luck and good fortune. Call me and let

Nevertheless, if you’ve got the time and the will to sort through the data
overload that the web now offers, you can certainly make a more informed investing and borrowing decision.
Still, beware. Many sites do not provide accurate data, nor does the
data necessarily relate to your speciﬁc need. For example, neighborhood
data and school data are plagued with inconsistencies, omissions, errors,
and ill-deﬁned measures. Don’t accept web-based data as the last word.
Check and verify all information. The web does not reduce your need to
“walk and talk” the neighborhood; visit schools, shops, parks other facilities; physically view comparable sales; and drive areas you might like to
search out “for sale” signs.
On a ﬁnal note, I will admit that real estate investing can seem challenging at times. But persevere. You’ll never regret owning. In the meantime, should you have questions about your investing, give me a call at
