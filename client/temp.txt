# Introduction to AI Agents
AI agents are systems designed to autonomously perform tasks using artificial intelligence models. They can handle information retrieval, question-answering, workflow automation, and more.

# Key Components of an AI Agent
1. **User Query Processing** – Understands and processes user input.
2. **Retrieval Module** – Fetches relevant context using a vector database.
3. **Language Model (LLM)** – Generates responses using an AI model.
4. **Response Generation** – Formats and refines responses for clarity.
5. **Feedback Mechanism** – Continuously improves based on user interactions.

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Overview
RAG is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with generative models to provide accurate and context-aware responses. It works by:
- Using embeddings to convert text into vector representations.
- Searching a vector database for similar context.
- Enhancing an LLM’s response with retrieved information.

# Choosing the Right LLM
When selecting an LLM for AI agents, consider:
- **Accuracy**: GPT-4, Claude, or Mistral for high-quality responses.
- **Speed**: Smaller models like GPT-3.5 for real-time interactions.
- **Cost**: Open-source models (LLaMA, Falcon) for cost-effective solutions.
- **Fine-tuning**: Custom training for domain-specific expertise.

# Vector Databases & Indexing Strategies
Vector databases store and search high-dimensional embeddings for efficient retrieval.
- **Popular Vector Databases**: FAISS, Weaviate, Pinecone, ChromaDB.
- **Indexing Methods**: HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World), IVF (Inverted File Index) for fast lookups.
- **Chunking Strategies**: Optimal chunk size (~200-500 tokens) improves retrieval efficiency.

# Best Practices for AI Agent Development
1. **Use Hybrid Search**: Combine vector search with keyword search for better results.
2. **Optimize Prompt Engineering**: Use system prompts and few-shot learning for better outputs.
3. **Cache Responses**: Reduce API calls by storing common queries.
4. **Rate Limit Handling**: Implement retry logic to avoid exceeding API limits.
5. **User Feedback Loop**: Train models based on real-world usage.

# Common Challenges and Troubleshooting
- **Hallucinations**: Limit LLM creativity by grounding responses in retrieved context.
- **Latency Issues**: Optimize embeddings and reduce query size for faster retrieval.
- **Relevance Filtering**: Use re-ranking algorithms to prioritize useful search results.
